  <h2 class='c009'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c013'>The conception of this “Story of Milk” dates many
years back. In his life-long study of problems connected
with dairy farming and milk industries in two
of the world’s greatest dairy countries, Denmark and
the United States, the author has felt the need of a
concise handbook covering this interesting subject. In
his forty years of work in the manufacture and distribution
of dairy and milk-food preparations he has
been brought constantly into contact with men and
women interested in the production of milk and has
found a persistent demand for a book that might be
consulted by anybody in regard to questions related to
these greatest of all foods, which are, or ought to be,
a most important part of the daily diet of children and
adults alike, at all times, everywhere.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a time during the war when, frightened
by the soaring of the price which had remained remarkably
low for many years, much too low in fact
compared with the cost of other food, people began to
cut down the consumption of milk to an alarming
extent. Even the National Food Administration for
a short time recommended saving in the wrong place,
forgetting that, at the highest figures reached during
the temporary shortage, milk was still one of the cheapest
of foods and that it was absolutely indispensable
for growing children and exceedingly beneficial for men
and women who were called upon to exercise their
physical and mental powers as never before. But with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XII'>XII</span>men like Dean Russell of the Wisconsin Agricultural
College in the Department and Dr. Graham Lusk
of Cornell University representing the United States
on the Inter-Allied Council of Alimentation, the Food
Administration could not long maintain this mistaken
attitude but quickly joined the College authorities and
the representatives of the dairy industry in advocating
a liberal use of milk. And the Department of Agriculture
sent out over the country a large force of demonstrators
to show the people how to use milk in making
cottage cheese and many other ways, and Agricultural
Colleges, Farm Bureaus and Home Economics Agents
worked hand in hand with Washington in disseminating
the knowledge of handling and utilizing milk.</p>

<p class='c014'>A genuine interest has been aroused in our country in
the economy and conservation of food, and in “The
Story of Milk” the author hopes to place at the disposal
of the student of Domestic Science a comprehensive
book of reference which may open the eyes of
many to the fact that there is no more interesting subject
than “Milk” in connection with the study of the
welfare and physical improvement of humanity, and
that milk and its products should be used to a much
greater extent than heretofore.</p>

<p class='c014'>It would make a long list of references if the author
should mention the sources on which he has drawn for
information beyond his own life-long experience in the
dairy and related industries. He desires to express his
sincere appreciation of the kindness and ready response
of institutions and friends to whom he has appealed
for photographs and cuts which have enabled him to
illustrate the text so liberally. In the back of the book
will be found a brief bibliography of standard dairy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XIII'>XIII</span>literature in which students may find material for
further information.</p>

<p class='c014'>Many interesting data and several excellent illustrations
have been obtained from the bulletins and collections
of the Department of Agriculture in Washington
and the Dairy Schools at Ithaca, N.Y., Madison, Wis.,
and Ames, Ia.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Chapter on Milk Cookery was written and classified
by the author’s wife, whose practical experience
will make it useful alike to housekeepers and students
of Domestic Science.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>HISTORICAL</h2>
</div>
<p class='c013'>Milk and its products have been known and used from
time immemorial. In the Bible milk and milk foods
are mentioned in some thirty places. In Gen. 18:8 we
read: “... and he (Abraham’s servant) took butter
and milk and set it before them ...”; 1 Sam. 17:28:
“And Jesse said unto David, his son: ... bring these
ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand and look
how thy brethren fare....”; Prov. 30:33: “For the
churning of milk bringeth forth butter,” etc.</p>

<p class='c014'>Though in some of these passages butter is mentioned
it is hardly probably that this product was really made
or used at the time under the climatic conditions in
Palestine. More likely it was various kinds of curd
and cheese which the translator called butter. At any
rate, the Hebrews of that far-off day coveted milk and
its products among their most valued foods. From
Egyptian, Greek and Roman history it appears that
knowledge of cheese goes back to the most ancient
times and that it was made from the milk of sheep,
goats, cows, asses, mares, in fact from all domestic
animals; in the far North, Lapps and Eskimos still
make it from the milk of the reindeer, the Arabs use
camel’s milk, Llama cheese is famous in the Cordilleras
and Zebu cheese in Ceylon and India.</p>

<p class='c014'>Even in ancient times the great food value of dairy
products was recognized. Plinius tells of Zoroaster that
for twenty years he lived exclusively on cheese, and
Plutarch calls cheese one of the most nourishing of foods.</p>

<p class='c014'>As time went by, the cow excelled all other domestic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XVI'>XVI</span>animals in capacity for the production of milk and by
constant use through centuries for the one special purpose,—by
care in feeding, breeding and selection,—special
breeds of cattle were developed which gave milk
in extraordinarily large quantities.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the cold climate of the northern countries where
butter will keep for a long time it has been made for
centuries. The illustration above is from a mural painting
in an old church in Finland. Evidently at the time
when that was built the devil already played havoc
with the churn and even up to the days of our grand-fathers
his Satanic Majesty was often accused of preventing
the butter from “coming.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_XVII'>XVII</span>Not until the middle of the nineteenth century did
dairying take its place among the important industries
of the world and science begin to be applied in its development.
Between 1860 and 1870 Thomas R.
Segelcke, the “Father of Scientific Dairying” in Denmark,
introduced the thermometer in churning instead
of the rule of thumb and started the keeping of records
in the manufacture of butter. N. J. Fjord started a
series of experiments in the creameries, continued
through the next decades, and which became models
for similar work throughout the world, covering pasteurization,
ice houses and cold storage, comparison
between various systems for raising the cream, separators,
feeding rations, etc., and Denmark developed its
agriculture and dairy industry to an enviable position.
About the same time Dr. Schatzman applied scientific
methods in cheese making in Switzerland and Jesse
Williams started the first American cheese factory near
Rome, N.Y., while L. B. Arnold, X. A. Willard, Harris
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XVIII'>XVIII</span>Lewis, Harry Burrell and many other progressive dairymen
made Herkimer County cheese famous.</p>

<p class='c014'>From New York, dairy farming spread rapidly westward
through Ohio to Michigan and Northern Illinois,
where butter making was developed around Elgin, and
to Wisconsin, where Governor Hoard preached the
gospel of progress, Babcock invented and gave to the
world the famous test that bears his name and Russell
made a specialty of dairy bacteriology.</p>

<p class='c014'>J. H. Monrad, Assistant Dairy Commissioner of
Illinois, student, writer and lecturer on dairy subjects,
collected and indexed one of the most complete
and valuable libraries of dairy literature found
anywhere, which after his death in 1915 was taken
over and installed in special rooms by Chr. Hansen’s
Laboratorium in Copenhagen, where a librarian
is keeping it up to date and it is open to the public.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Canada, Dairy Commissioners Jas. W. Robertson
and J. A. Ruddick, D. M. McPherson, the “Cheese
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XIX'>XIX</span>King,” and others contributed to an enormous development
of the manufacture of high-class cheese, and
in New Zealand and Australia similar progress was
made.</p>

<p class='c014'>Business and science have vied with each other in increasing
the output of dairy products and improving
their quality. In the table below, showing estimates
for 1917, some interesting figures are given of the
amount of milk produced in the United States and the
uses to which it is applied.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_XX'>XX</span>Although the table accounts for all the milk produced,
it does not tell the whole story, since the preparation
of a number of products results in the formation
of vast quantities of by-products that are not used to
the fullest advantage for human food.</p>

<p class='c014'>New York City alone consumes 1,600,000 quarts of
milk a day, but even this enormous quantity means
only 0.6 pint per capita. The consuming public has
been slow to realize the value of milk and its products,
and too much emphasis cannot be laid upon the fact
that even at the largely increased cost of all dairy
products they are still some of the cheapest and the
most healthful of foods, especially for growing children,
and should be used in much larger quantities.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Milk-Breeds.</b>—The black and white <i>Holstein-Friesians</i>
(which, by the way, had their home in Holland and not
in Holstein) are known for
their large production of
not very rich milk, while
the <i>Guernseys</i> and <i>Jerseys</i>
give milk exceedingly
rich in butter-fat.
A good Holstein cow will
give from 7,000 to 10,000
lbs. of milk in a year,
containing from 3¼% to 4% butter-fat. Some of them
produce as much as 20,000 to 30,000 lbs. in a year—nearly
4,000 gallons—just think of it! Jersey cows will
usually not produce as much in quantity as the Holsteins
but Jersey milk often contains 5% or 6% or more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>butter-fat, and a few of the best have been known to
produce 800 to 900 lbs. of butter in one year, an amount
equal to the cow’s own
weight. The red <i>Danish</i>
cow is an exceedingly good
and highly bred milk producer
which, however, has
not been introduced in
the United States, but the
Scotch <i>Ayrshires</i> and the
<i>Brown Swiss</i> are other
well-known dairy breeds
which are in favor with many American farmers.</p>

where two full-blooded

bred and developed for
the purpose of producing
beef rather than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>milk are called by contrast beef-cattle. As examples of
beef-cows look at the <i>Shorthorns</i> or the <i>Herefords</i> or the
<i>Polled Angus</i> at the next State Fair you visit and notice
the square, deep, smooth body with muscles and fat
strongly developed in
contrast to the loosely
built, bony milk-cow
with its tendency to
turn all its food into
milk at the expense of
the body. There are,
however, also among
the Shorthorns, strains
of good milkers, but as

farm, and “dual purpose” cows are not usually profitable.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Food and Water.</b>—The natural food for the dairy
cow in summer is grass, and where rich, succulent grass
and clover grow in abundance, as on the fertile meadows
of Holland and the Channel Islands, or the Swiss Alps,
the highly cultivated Danish farms, the eastern and
middle-western states of America, etc., dairying early
reached its highest development. As the value of milk
and its products for human food became more generally
recognized and all-the-year-round production was
forced, it was found necessary to feed the cows heavily
in winter too, not only hay, but also grain and succulent
food such as beets and corn-ensilage (green corn cut,
stalks, cobs and all, and packed in a silo), and science
was taken into play to formulate <i>Balanced Rations</i> containing
the proper amounts and proportions of the various
nutrients—Protein, Fat and Carbohydrates. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>is not the place here to go deeper into this problem
which has long been a subject for thorough research
and experiments. In fact, more attention has been
paid to the feeding of cattle than to the proper nourishment
of human beings, and much of what we know
about the latter has been deducted from experience
and study on the dairy farm, and from laboratory work
along that line. In the chapter on “Milk as a Food”
we are taking up food values, etc., in relation to the
feeding of children and men. Suffice it here to say
that the same fundamental principles apply to the feeding
of calves and cattle for the production of milk and
beef. And we wish to emphasize the fact that, with
due consideration to the proper proportion between the
various groups of nutrients, it is much more important
that the food is succulent, appetizing and easily digestible
than that the ration shall be accurately balanced.</p>

<p class='c014'>This fact, long well known to practical breeders and
dairymen, has recently been confirmed by Dr. E. V.
McCullom to whose experiments further reference is
made in the chapter on milk as a food for children. He
shows that there is a very great difference in the quality
of Protein and Fat from various sources and that there
is “Something Unknown” in butter-fat, for instance,
which is absent in most other fats and which is vital
for the growth of the child as well as for the proper
nourishment of man. This unknown but essential substance
is also found, in small quantities, in the leaves
of certain plants, as in alfalfa, while it is absent in the
grain of the cereals.</p>

<p class='c014'>Contrary to a general impression one cannot feed fat
into the milk. A large amount of oil cake or other food
rich in fat in the daily ration does not increase the percentage
of butter-fat in the milk. Rather, it depends
largely upon the breed and to some extent upon the
period of lactation. Provided the food agrees with her
digestion and keeps the cow in a good, healthy condition,
the composition of the milk is not changed to any
appreciable extent by a change in make-up of the food.</p>

<p class='c014'>It goes without saying that to produce from 20 to 50
lbs. of milk a day the cow must have an abundance of
<i>fresh, pure water</i> to drink and she should not have access
to stagnant water.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>The Barn</b> must be clean, light and well ventilated and
the cows should be milked with clean hands into a clean
pail which is covered as far as possible so as to prevent
dust from falling into the milk, or with one of the
excellent milking machines which are now frequently
used in large dairies. The milk is strained and cooled
immediately after milking.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c014'><b>Milking.</b>—The cows are usually milked twice a day;
occasionally, when the highest possible yield is desired,
as in important tests, three or four times. The first
five days after the birth of the calf the milk,—the
Colostrum so called,—is not
normal and should not be used
for human consumption. It
may be fed to the calf. The
first three to four months the
yield of milk generally is
higher than later, when it
gradually drops until after
about ten months it stops altogether
and the cow goes
“dry” at least for some six
weeks before dropping the
next calf. The highest annual
yield may be obtained by having the cows “come in”
in the Fall or early Winter and feeding them well all
Winter to keep up
an abundant flow of
milk. Then, when
they come out on
pasture in the
Spring,—in the latitude
of the Great
Lakes about May
15th,—the fresh,
rich feed will stimulate
production and
give it a fresh start
so that the milk-pail may continue to be filled during
the next few months and the shrinkage of the yield will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>not occur until the time when the pastures dry up.
The cow will then go dry in the early Fall, when feed
is scarce. Usually, however, the cows are allowed to
“come in” in the Spring and the yield of milk begins
to shrink in the late Summer with little or nothing
in the Winter.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'><b>Test the Cows.</b>—To ascertain if a cow pays for her
feed the amount and the quality of the milk should
be tested and computed for the year. If the milk from
each cow cannot be weighed every day it may be done
regularly once a month or preferably oftener. If it is
weighed morning and evening once every ten days it
is easy to keep the account by multiplying the number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>of pounds by ten and adding the totals for the year.
Occasionally the milk may be subjected to the Babcock
Test to ascertain its richness; three or four times during
the period of lactation is sufficient.</p>

<p class='c014'>Where farmers do not have time to do the testing
themselves they often combine and hire a young
man or woman, trained in an agricultural college, to
go around from farm to farm and do the work. These
experts not only test the yield and the percentage of
fat but also weigh and compute the feed so as to help
the farmer make up his rations and calculate whether
each cow pays for her feed or not. The members of
these associations meet and compare notes and a
friendly rivalry is stimulated which may do much
toward increasing production. As a matter of fact,
where Cow Test Associations have been introduced,
both yield and quality of the milk have been largely
increased.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Healthy Cows</b> alone can be depended upon to produce
sanitary milk. In many herds of milk-cows tuberculosis
is prevalent, and constant vigilance is necessary
to prevent its spread. The <i>Tuberculin Test</i> discovered
by Koch is invaluable for the purpose of ascertaining
the presence of tuberculosis. It is not necessary, however,
to kill every infected animal. Only where the
lungs or the udder is affected and a physical examination
shows an advanced stage of the disease such
radical means are advisable. When the tuberculin test
was first introduced many valuable herds were wantonly
and foolishly killed off because some of the highly developed
dairy cows showed reaction to the test while
worthless scrubs were allowed to live and spread the
disease. For only the intelligent and public-spirited

<b>Butter-Fat</b> is found in milk in the form of minute
globules suspended in the liquid. As fat or oil is lighter
than water (has less specific gravity) it naturally floats
and the fat globules therefore soon rise to the top when
milk stands at rest, forming a layer of <i>cream</i> which
may be skimmed off from the <i>milk</i>. In chemical composition
butter-fat is very nearly the same as other

may make a lot
of difference in digestibility

Oleomargarine, Butterine, Nut-Butter and

because a chemical analysis shows them

and legitimate if sold for what they are, but
should never be allowed to be sold or served
for what they are not, genuine butter.</p>

distinguished from the latter by being precipitated

albumin. Casein may also be precipitated by

<p class='c022'>Milk may be adulterated or decreased
in value either by skimming
or by watering. In either case the
percentage of the most valuable constituent,
the butter-fat, is diminished.
It is upon this fact that the most practical
test, the Babcock, is based.</p>

with strong sulphuric acid the butter-fat is liberated as
an oil. By subjecting the mixture to centrifugal force
the light butter oil is separated from the rest of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>milk and the percentage can be easily determined.
Centrifugal force had already been used in the Fjord
Cream Test, but it remained for Dr.
Babcock to work out the splendid
practical and reliable test which bears
his name and in which he has given
to the world an invention of incalculable
value.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Sampling.</b>—Whether it is new milk
or skim milk or buttermilk or cream
that is to be tested the first thing to observe is to take
a <i>truly representative sample</i>. The liquid must be thoroughly
mixed by pouring it several times from one vessel
to another, or stirring vigorously.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>It may not always be convenient to make a test immediately
when the sample is taken. In the creamery
where the milk is paid for according to its fat contents,
samples are taken every day from every patron’s
milk and it would take too much time for the butter
maker to test all of these samples before they would
spoil. A preservative, corrosive sublimate,—poisonous
but all right for the purpose,—is therefore added and
all the samples of one farmer’s milk for several days
or a whole week are put together in one glass to be kept
and tested at one time. This is called a composite test
and has proven entirely satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>The Lactometer</b> has been used to discover adulterations,
depending upon the difference in specific gravity
of the various constituents. The specific gravity of
whole milk is about 1.032 which means that, if a certain
volume of water weighs 1.000 weight units, the same
volume of whole milk weighs 1.032, the same volume
of butter-fat weighs, say, .900, or of cream about 1.000,
and of skim milk 1.036 units. If the Lactometer shows
a sample of milk to have a higher specific gravity than
1.032 it may therefore be suspected of having been
skimmed. But it will readily be seen that by removing
from whole milk some of the cream and adding water,
the specific gravity can easily be brought back to normal
for whole milk. This test is therefore unreliable and has
been discarded with the advent of the Babcock.</p>

cream, which depends upon the amount of lactic acid
developed in it, may
be tested by a liquid
normal alkali or by the
Farrington Alkaline
Tablets, a solution of
which added to sour
milk neutralizes the
acid. A few drops of
an indicator, Phenolpthalein,
added to the
milk, turns it pink
when all the acid has
been neutralized, and
the amount of alkali
solution used shows
the percentage of acid
in the milk. This is
quite important in
preparing “starters”
for ripening the cream

etc.</p>

<div class='fn'>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>There are other tests used in scientific dairying as the
<i>Fermentation Test</i> to ascertain the relative purity of
milk, the <i>Casein Test</i>, etc., but the above are those
mostly used besides the <i>Bacterial Count</i> which is mentioned
under the chapter on “Milk Supply,” and the
<i>Rennet Test</i> described under “Cheese Making.”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>FERMENTS</h3>

<p class='c022'>Two classes of ferments are of importance in connection
with milk: (1) “unorganized” or chemical ferments,
the “enzymes,” and (2) “organized” ferments
such as bacteria and yeast.</p>
<h4 class='c024'><i>Enzymes</i></h4>
<p class='c022'><b>Rennet.</b>—Among the unorganized ferments, <i>Rennet</i>
or <i>Rennin</i> is highly important on account of its power
of coagulating or curdling milk by precipitation of the
casein. Rennet is extracted from the stomach of the
suckling or milk-fed calf, where it serves in digesting
the calf’s food. It is in the market in the form of a
liquid extract as well as a dry powder compressed into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>tablets (Rennet Tablets and Junket Tablets). The
characteristics and use of rennet are described under
“Cheese Making” in Chapter <a href='#ch03'>III</a>.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Pepsin</b> is another enzyme the office of which in the
process of digestion is to dissolve albuminoids. It is
not considered identical with rennet though in an acid
solution it will curdle milk. It occurs in the stomachs
of grown animals fed on solid food and is usually produced
from hogs’ stomachs.</p>
<h4 class='c025'>Bacteria</h4>

<p class='c022'>Everywhere, in the air, in water, in the soil, and
clinging to every object in the world, are minute organisms
known under the common names of <i>bacteria</i>
or <i>microbes</i>. In contrast to rennet and the other
“unorganized” ferments, bacteria belong to the “organized”
class. Some are harmful, producing putrefaction,
dissolution, poisons or disease; others are beneficial,
leading to desirable fermentations and changes;
others again are indifferent, neither good nor bad, but
harmless.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the milk comes from the cow it is almost free from
bacteria, but milk makes an excellent soil for many of
these organisms to grow in, and they soon get in, to
multiply with enormous rapidity at any temperature
from 60° to 100° F.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Lactic Acid Bacilli</b> are bacteria of special importance
to the dairyman, for they convert sugar of milk into
lactic acid and produce various more or less agreeable
flavors. They are also powerful germicides and scavengers,
destroying or neutralizing the products of other
bacteria which in the absence of these bacteria and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>lactic acid produced by them would play havoc with the
food and produce putrefaction or disease. Everybody
who handles milk knows that pure sour milk or buttermilk
in which lactic acid bacteria abound keeps well
for a long time, free from other fermentations which
have no chance to develop in their presence. It is due
to this purifying property that Metchnikoff recommended
Bulgarian sour milk as a health food, asserting
that it prevents harmful fermentations in the digestive
channel.</p>
<h4 class='c025'>The Control of Bacteria</h4>

<p class='c022'>The principal means at our disposal to prevent or
control and regulate bacterial growth are:</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Cleanliness</i>, <i>Heat</i>, <i>Cold</i> and <i>Disinfectants</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Cleanliness.</b>—Only the most scrupulous cleanliness
will prevent contamination. Hence the necessity of
thorough scouring and sterilizing of all utensils, and
the need for fresh air and pure water.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Heat.</b>—The prevention of fermentation in milk by
heating is called “sterilization” or “pasteurization”
according to the intensity of the heat and the length
of time the milk is subjected to it. Boiling destroys
almost all bacterial life. Some germs require, however,
exposure to a much higher temperature, up to 250° F.
(boiling under pressure), to be entirely eradicated, but
for all practical purposes a thorough boiling is considered
sufficient to eliminate all danger of contamination.
Such boiling is usually termed <i>Sterilization</i>.</p>

<p class='c027'>If the milk had contained 1,000 bacteria per cubic

would have contained 4,100 bacteria at the end of 24

<p class='c014'>But even <i>frost does not kill</i> the bacteria. If milk
which has been kept sweet or at the desired degree of
sourness by cooling is allowed to get warm again, the
bacteria which have been kept dormant will get a fresh
start. For this reason milk and cream for city supply
should not only be cooled strongly, but must be kept
thoroughly chilled up to the time they are used, which
means that they should be delivered cool to the consumer,
and kept on ice in the house, never being allowed
to warm up until used.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>PASTEURIZATION</h3>
<div  class='figright id002'>
<img src='images/i025.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>Louis Pasteur, French scientist and originator of the process of pasteurization.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Pasteurization depends upon the
fact that almost all bacteria, and
especially the disease-producing species,
are checked in their growth and
made harmless, if not totally destroyed,
by instantaneous exposure
to a temperature of 175° F., or a
more or less prolonged exposure to
lower temperature, for instance
for 20 minutes to 157° or 30 minutes to 145°. These
lower temperatures are recommended in the case of new
milk to be consumed as such, in order not to change its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>digestibility. Pasteurizers with “holding devices” are
therefore largely taking the place of the “continuous”
sterilizing machines, which allow only momentary exposure
to the highest temperature.</p>

<p class='c014'>Whatever method is used it is essential that after the
heating is finished the milk should be cooled as quickly
as possible to a temperature sufficiently low to prevent
development of the germs that have not been entirely
destroyed by the heat and which, if the milk is left
for any length of time at a temperature favorable for
bacterial life—anywhere between 65° and 110°,—will
begin to grow again. Cool the milk to below 60° and
if possible to 50° or 40°.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sometimes a second pasteurization is practiced, the
milk being purposely allowed to stand at 70° to 80°
for 12 to 24 hours after the first pasteurization for the
germs which escaped destruction to develop into full-grown
bacteria. They are then killed by the second
heating before the milk is finally chilled to stop any
further growth.</p>

<p class='c014'>Pasteurization can be done by placing the milk in
any tin or enamelled or glass vessel, set in another vessel
containing water (a double boiler). Heat until the
milk has reached the desired temperature, hold it at
that temperature the necessary time, and then place
the vessel in cold running water or in ice water until
the milk is thoroughly chilled. It is not advisable to
place the hot milk in the ice box as cooling in air is too
slow. Not until it is thoroughly cooled in water is it
safe to put it in the ice box to <i>keep</i> it cool.</p>

now connected with the New York State Department
of Agriculture, first brought the
process to this country and used
pasteurization in a city creamery in
Kentucky. American experiment
stations established the temperatures
and the time of exposure necessary
for best results, and no one has
done more for the introduction of
pasteurization than the New York
philanthropist, Nathan Straus, who
has established pasteurizing plants
and milk distributing stations in
many localities, thereby contributing so largely to the
lowering of the death rate among the children of the
poor.</p>

pot) with boiling water.</p>

<p class='c014'>4. Place tray (a), with the filled bottles, into the pot
(b), so that the bottom of the tray rests on the three
supports, and put cover (c) on quickly.</p>

<p class='c014'>5. After the bottles have been warmed up by the
steam for five minutes, remove the cover quickly, turn
the tray so that it drops into the water. The cover is
to be put on again immediately. This manipulation
is to be made very quickly, so that as little steam as
possible can escape. Thus it remains for twenty-five
minutes.</p>

<p class='c014'>6. Now take the tray out of the water and cool the
bottles with cold water and ice as quickly as possible,
and keep them at this low temperature till used.</p>

<p class='c014'>7. Before use, warm the milk—in the bottles—to
blood heat. Never pour it into another vessel.</p>

<p class='c014'>8. The milk must not be used for children later than
twenty-four hours after pasteurization. Never use
remnants.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>PURE CULTURES</h3>
<div  class='figleft id002'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Professor V. Storch, originator of pure cultures for ripening cream and milk</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Before 1890 it was supposed that the flavor of fine
butter depended upon certain volatile oils and acids
peculiar to butter-fat. In the early
nineties Professor V. Storch of
the Danish Experiment Station
showed, however, that it was
due rather to the products of
bacteria and he isolated the lactic
acid bacilli which would produce
such exquisite flavor even when perfectly
neutral and tasteless butter-fat
was churned with milk acidified
or ripened with a pure culture of
these bacilli. In this country Dr.
H. W. Conn of Wesleyan University,
Storrs, Conn., did much to advance the theory and
practice of ripening cream with a pure culture starter.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Pure cultures” are produced in the bacteriological
laboratory by picking out under the microscope colonies
of the desired species of bacteria, planting them
in a sterilized medium and allowing them to grow under
the most favorable conditions and with the exclusion
of all other germs.</p>

<p><span class='small'>Bacterium lactis acidi (from Storch)</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>When such a culture has reached its maximum growth
it is transplanted into a larger quantity of a sterilized
medium containing proper nourishment for the particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>organism. In the bacteriological laboratory,
where alone absolute sterility of utensils and medium,
and entire exclusion of foreign infection are possible,
the culture may remain pure while this inoculation and
propagation are repeated over and over again. But
when the propagation is carried on in the house or the
dairy, for instance in preparing starters or buttermilk,
such absolute cleanliness is impossible and in the long
run infections will creep in from the air or from the
utensils and after a while it becomes necessary to
start with a new “pure culture.” How often such
renewal must be resorted to depends largely upon the
surroundings and the care of the operator. Usually it
must be done after a week’s time, although it is surprising
to find milk preparations made by the simplest
processes equal in purity to those prepared with the
assistance of bacteriological science and technique.
This is, for instance, the case in Bulgaria, where the
famous Yoghourt sour milk is prepared pure without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>special care and in Denmark where the country is fairly
permeated with the lactic acid bacilli used in ripening
the cream for the celebrated Danish butter and where
careful buttermakers often maintain their starters for
months or even for years without “renewal.”</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Typical lactic acid bacteria<br />(L. A. Rogers)</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>There are many different varieties of bacteria which
convert sugar of milk into lactic acid, at the same time
developing flavors more or less agreeable and characteristic
for the various
products. In the bacteriological
laboratory
certain species are selected
which will produce
the results desired
for the particular
purpose in view.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Starters.</b>—Beginning
with a commercial dry
culture in the form of
a powder as generally
used in the creamery
or the cheese factory
as well as for the preparation
of commercial buttermilk, or with buttermilk tablets
as used in the ordinary household or the hospital,
such culture is added to a small quantity of thoroughly
pasteurized milk. If fresh, sweet skim milk is available it
is preferable to whole milk as the butter-fat in the latter
only interferes with the process; but either can be used.</p>

<p class='c014'>Milk for starters should be strongly pasteurized by
being kept at a temperature near the boiling point—at
least 180°—for 40 to 60 minutes, then cooled to the
degree at which it is to be set, usually between 65° and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>75°, somewhat higher for the first propagation with the
pure culture than for the subsequent transplantings
when the bacteria, more or less dormant in the dry
powder or tablets, have attained full vitality. Some
species of bacteria, as the Bacillus Bulgaricus, require
higher temperatures—90° to 100° or even 110°—than
others. The culture having been thoroughly incorporated
in the milk by vigorous and repeated stirring
or shaking, the milk is left at rest in an incubator or a
waterbath or wrapped in paper or cloth in a warm room
where an even temperature can be maintained, until
it is curdled, which may take 18 to 24 hours or even
longer for the first propagation.</p>

<p class='c014'>One part of this curdled milk is now added to 5 or 10
parts of fresh pasteurized milk and set to ripen in the
same way as described above, possibly at a little lower
temperature, and this is repeated every day, thus maintaining
the “Mother Starter.” After the second or
third propagation the bulk of each batch is used as a
starter in the larger lot of material to be ripened, be it
cream for butter or milk for cheese or for commercial
buttermilk, while a little is taken for maintenance of
the mother starter as described above.</p>

<p class='c014'>The <i>amount of starter</i> to prepare every day depends
upon the amount of milk or cream to be ripened and
the per cent of starter used in same. For instance, if
you have ten gallons of cream to ripen every day in
which you wish to use about 10% or 12% starter, or one
gallon, take a little less than one pint of the first or
second propagation for one gallon of milk; the next
day use one pint of this to add to a gallon of fresh
starter milk, and the remaining gallon to add to the
ten gallons of cream, and so on every day.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>If you have 4,000 lbs. of milk in the cheese vat to
ripen with 2% or 80 lbs. starter, prepare 88 lbs. of
mother starter. If, on the other hand, you wish to
make only a quart of buttermilk every day, take, say,
two buttermilk tablets, crush them thoroughly in a
spoonful of pasteurized milk and stir this into a tumblerful
of the same milk; let stand till it is thickened
the next day and use a tablespoonful of this thickened
milk in a quart of fresh pasteurized milk which when
ripened is your buttermilk, from which you take out
a tablespoonful for starter in the next batch, and so on.
In this case there is no “mother starter” except that
perhaps the first tumblerful prepared with the tablets
may be called so, but afterwards the starter is taken
right out of the finished product every day.</p>

<p class='c014'>The process may be modified to suit special purposes
and local conditions, but the following precautions
should be strictly observed: (1) to interrupt the ripening
immediately by quick and intense cooling as soon
as it has reached the proper point in case the ripened
product is not used at once, and (2) to <i>keep</i> it ice-cold
until it is used. If this is done, it may be kept for two
or three days without deterioration if it is not convenient
to make it fresh every day which, however, should
be the rule.</p>

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c009'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Milk Supply and Creamery Products</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c013'>In the first chapter the composition of cow’s milk
and the nature of its constituents have been considered,
the most important tests for its richness and purity
have been described, and the ferments have been mentioned
which instigate changes for good or for bad,
together with the means at disposal for regulating their
activity. To use these means intelligently in handling
milk and its products is the key to the dairyman’s
success.</p>

<p class='c014'>We shall now briefly consider the various steps that
are of importance in modern dairy industry.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>MILK SUPPLY</h3>

<p class='c022'>In the first place, the farmer must furnish pure, clean,
unadulterated milk, fresh from the cow and cooled
immediately after milking. His cows must be healthy.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Bovine Tuberculosis.</b>—Many milk-cows, for the very
reason that they have been bred with the one purpose
in view of turning all their food into milk and wasting
as little as possible in building up the body, are more
or less weak-chested and apt to suffer from tuberculosis.
Unless this disease is so far advanced as to
affect the general health of the cow, or it has spread
to the milk organs, the udder and the teats, it is not
so dangerous as has heretofore been supposed. It is
now held by the great majority of physicians that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>bovine tuberculosis is hardly ever transmitted to grown
persons and seldom to children. Neither is it hereditary.
Nevertheless, wherever it is possible to have
the herd tested with tuberculin, segregating, if not
killing, the animals which show by reaction that they
are somewhat tuberculous, it should be done. Milk
from such cows should always be pasteurized.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Milk as a Disease Carrier.</b>—A greater danger lies
in the fact that, warm as it comes from the cow, milk
is an ideal medium for human disease germs to grow
in, and may thus become a great conveyor of such
germs. For this reason it is of the greatest importance
that the milkers are healthy and clean, that the udders
and teats be free from dirt, and the milk pail covered
as far as possible; the barn must be clean, and every
source of infection excluded. This fact also points to
the advisability of pasteurization. On page <a href='#Page_23'>23</a> a chart
is shown, published by the Toronto Board of Health
and indicating the temperatures at which various germs
of disease are made harmless.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Bacterial Count.</b>—The test for clean milk now mostly
used is the “Bacterial Count,” the number of bacteria—or
rather colonies of bacteria—found in a cubic
centimeter of the milk. It would be better if the nature
or quality of the bacteria could be taken into consideration
as well as the quantity, but that being as yet
impracticable, the next best thing is to depend upon
the number. Ordinary good milk often contains hundreds
of thousands of bacteria in a cubic centimeter,
but where the greatest cleanliness is observed the
number may be less than 1,000.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Certified Milk</b> is now sold in many cities which, according
to varying city ordinances, is guaranteed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>have less than 10,000 or 20,000 or 30,000 bacteria, as
the case may be.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i037.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Counting the bacteria in a cubic centimeter of milk</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The cost of producing certified milk places it beyond
the reach of the great majority of consumers. But
such care and cleanliness as can be observed by the
farmer and the milkman without extra expense should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>be insisted upon, and milk which nevertheless contains
a large number of bacteria can be made safe by pasteurization.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>The Sanitary Code.</b>—The regulation of the production
and delivery of milk in cities and towns as well
as at creameries and cheese factories, the “Sanitary
Code” established by state and municipal health authorities,
has been very effective in improving the
quality of the supply. So enormous have been the
improvements in caring for and handling the products
by the large establishments engaged in the delivery of
milk as to make the increase in cost seem trifling compared
with the great benefit to the public health secured
by these agencies.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>New York State Milk Grading.</b>—The New York
State Board of Health prescribes a grading for milk
offered for sale, the most important features of which
are as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Certified.</i>—Must be produced under specially sanitary
conditions approved by a county medical commission.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Grade A Raw.</i>—Cows must be tuberculin tested and
milk must not contain over 60,000 bacteria per cubic
centimeter.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Grade A Pasteurized.</i>—Cows must be subjected to
physical examination and milk must not contain more
than 200,000 bacteria before, nor more than 30,000
after pasteurization.</p>

<p class='c014'>Other grades permitted under the rules, all subject
to inspection and approval of the authorities, are:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Grade B Raw.</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Grade B Pasteurized.</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Grade C Raw.</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Grade C Pasteurized.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Deliveries must be made within a certain time after
production or pasteurization, barns and milk stations
are inspected, and altogether such safeguards are employed
as to make the supply exceedingly safe and
reliable.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>City Delivery.</b>—In villages and small cities the milk
supply is still to a large extent in the hands of farmers
who come to town early in the morning peddling their
milk, often at considerable waste of time for horse and
man. Or a number of peddlers go over the same route
so that it takes a dozen wagons to cover a town where
three or four could do it.</p>

<p class='c014'>As long as there was no efficient regulation as to price
and quality such waste was perhaps unavoidable, as
competition on the part of the producers and distributors
was the only means of protection for the consumers.
But lately state and municipal control is
being exercised to such an extent as to largely eliminate
the danger of poor milk and exorbitant prices. Further
development of organized delivery systems so much to
be desired for sanitary as well as for economical reasons,
may be looked for as soon as normal conditions return
after the close of the war. The delivery of milk is one
of the things that in the interest of public health must
be under the strictest official control, and <i>co-operation</i>
between farmers and consumers is the logical system
for elimination of unnecessary expenses of distribution
and for prompt and satisfactory service. Their interests
are or should be identical and both classes are
hurt by inefficient and wasteful delivery.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the large cities there has grown up an industry
which largely monopolizes the milk supply and which
until lately was powerful enough to dictate prices and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>conditions both for producers and consumers. Several
attempts have been made from time to time by farmers
to combine to regulate prices and dictate the terms to
the middlemen. Such attempts have, however, invariably
failed as long as they were built on false
economic principles and prompted by selfish interests
only. No farmers’ association can be strong enough to
ignore the law of supply and demand, and it is only
quite recently that the <i>Dairymen’s League</i> has succeeded
in influencing the market by taking into consideration
the actual cost of production of milk as
worked out by the agricultural colleges, and fixing the
price on a scientific basis. There is one other element
entering into the causes on which the price to the consumers
depends, namely, <i>Transportation</i>, and while
municipal boards of health are looking after the sanitary
conditions and prevention of adulteration, State and
Federal authorities are stepping in as moderators or
arbitrators to reconcile the interests of the <i>Producers</i>,
the <i>Railroad Companies</i>, the <i>Distributors</i> and the <i>Consumers</i>.
The next step in the development will no
doubt be towards full co-operation between producers
and consumers and, to a large extent, elimination of
the “middlemen.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It should not be forgotten, however, that while the
much abused middlemen in time past have been able to
dictate terms and prices and have often abused the
privilege; they have at the same time used their influence
and power to improve the milk supply. As the
supply of oil and gasoline has been perfected and cheapened
by the all-powerful Standard Oil Co. as a monopoly
crushing all competition, so the “Milk Trust” has
improved the distribution of milk and has built up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>magnificent sanitary plants in which milk is handled,
pasteurized, bottled and distributed in a way that
might not have been possible without the monopoly.
It has served a good purpose, but has at the same time
acquired such power that official control has become
necessary for the protection of producers and consumers
alike, and the time may be near when these two
classes will combine and take the matter into their own
hands so that the distribution may be done at actual
cost.</p>

<p><span class='small'>Milk station in the country where milk is received from the farmers to be shipped to the city</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c014'><b>Milk Stations</b> are plants erected in dairy sections in
the country either by the city milk supply houses or
by co-operating farmers, where the milk is delivered
and handled so as to make it ready for shipment to
the city. As in the creamery and the cheese factory,
the milk is carefully examined and, if it is not sweet
and pure, it is rejected and sent back to the farm. Any
impure flavor remains in the cover for some time and
is easily detected by smelling of the cover as soon as
it is removed from the can.</p>

<p class='c014'>A sample is taken and put aside for the Babcock
test and perhaps another for the Fermentation test.
Each farmer’s milk is weighed in the <i>Weigh Can</i> and
run through a cheese-cloth strainer. The further treatment
varies in different plants. The milk may simply
be cooled by running it over a cold water or brine cooler
and placing it in shipping cans in the refrigerator or in
ice water until the milk-train comes along to pick up
the cans. Or it may be clarified by running it through
a centrifugal machine, the same as a separator, in which,
however, cream and milk are not separated, but impurities
are thrown out by the centrifugal force and
deposited on the wall of the bowl, and the purified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>milk may then be pasteurized and bottled before being
shipped to the city.</p>

<p><span class='small'>Receiving milk at the milk station</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Arriving in the city in iced cars the milk is taken to
one of the elaborate plants in which it is pasteurized
and bottled, if that has not been done at the country
station. The machinery used in these plants is getting
more and more perfect and expensive and leaves little
to be desired as to sanitary requirements and economy
in handling. Pasteurizers, bottling machines, bottle-washing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>machines, conveyors, etc., are wonders of ingenuity,
and one needs only to see one of these modern
plants to understand that in a large city milk can only
be handled to advantage in expensive establishments.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Skim Milk</b> is one of the cheapest of foods and under
proper regulations its sale should not be prohibited.
The reason why in times past skim milk has been discredited
and excluded from sale was that, as produced
by the old methods of raising the cream, before the
advent of the separator, it was always more or less
old and sour before it was available and certainly before
it could be distributed to consumers. Under such
conditions it was hardly ever fit for human food. But
when produced by the separator and pasteurized and
cooled immediately after—within a few hours after
milking, which is entirely feasible—it is an excellent
and nutritious food for adults and even for children
over two years of age. Ripened with a pure culture of
lactic acid bacteria, it makes a healthful, refreshing
drink, like buttermilk. Only when it is allowed to sour
without proper care or control does skim milk, as whole
milk does, become unfit for food or drink. On a cold
winter morning when men are going to work (or perhaps
are looking for work which they cannot find),
and children are on their way to school, often underfed,
a street-corner wagon or stand where boiling hot, fresh,
sweet skim milk might be distributed at a cent or two
a glass would be a blessing in any city.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>CREAM</h3>

<p class='c022'>When new milk is left at rest the cream will rise
to the top and after 12 to 24 hours a cream-line can
be seen in the bottle. This cream-line is sharper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>and more easily seen in raw milk than in pasteurized
milk and its absence is not always a sure sign of
lack of richness or purity of the milk. By cooling the
milk thoroughly so that it will keep, almost all the
cream will be at the top in forty-eight hours and can
be skimmed off. The cream can be used for coffee or
on cereals or fruits or puddings; the skim milk left
will still hold ½% or more of butter-fat and can be
used to drink or for cooking.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>The Separator.</b>—On the farm or in the creamery the
cream is no longer raised by gravity, that is, by letting
the milk “set” either in shallow pans on the kitchen
shelf or in deep cans in ice water, but the fresh, warm
milk is run through the separator in a continuous
stream.</p>

<div  class='figleft id002'>
<img src='images/i046.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Early conception of the separator</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>It was noticed that the rising of the cream due to the
difference in specific gravity between the butter-fat and
the milk-“serum” (the watery
solution of the other constituents)
might be greatly hastened
by subjecting the milk to centrifugal
force. This physical phenomenon
was taken advantage
of in the first conception of the
separator where it was shown
that if a pail of milk was whirled
around like a stone in a sling the
heavier milk-serum would be
thrown towards the bottom of the
separator pail with so much greater force
than the lighter cream (butter-fat mixed with a small
part of the serum) that the separation which would take
48 hours in the milk at rest, could be accomplished in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>few minutes when exposed to centrifugal force. From
this early crude attempt the continuous <i>bowl-separator</i>
was developed and still later a
number of divisions in the bowl
were designed which increased
the capacity and efficiency of
the machine wonderfully. The
most successful separator was
designed by Dr. Gustaf De
Laval of Sweden and the machines
bearing his name are used
all over the world where butter
is made. But there are many
other excellent separators on
the market.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Dr. Gustaf De Laval of Sweden, inventor of the separator bearing his name</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In the machine the milk is
separated instantaneously by centrifugal force and runs
out through two tubes, one for cream and the other for
skim milk. A small modern hand
machine will take care of from 200
to 1,000 lbs. of milk an hour, and
power machines are built to separate
6,000 lbs. or more. By regulating
the cream-outlet a heavier
or lighter cream can be produced.</p>

<img src='images/i047b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Hand separator</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Suppose we are separating some
milk containing 4% butter-fat. If
⅛ of this milk is separated out as
cream and contains all the butter-fat,
the cream will be eight times as
rich in butter-fat as the original
milk; 32% of the cream will be butter-fat. Such cream
is called “32% cream.” If we take ¼ as cream, we get a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>cream four times as rich as the milk, a “16% cream.”
So out of 100 lbs. of milk we can take 12½ lbs. (⅛)
of 32% cream, 25 lbs. (¼) of 16% cream, etc.</p>

<p class='c014'>Although the skim milk is really valuable as a food,
it is worth but little commercially; the cream containing
the butter-fat is the expensive part of the milk,
and we must be prepared to pay for the cream all that
the milk would have cost.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Percentage of Butter-Fat.</b>—The “richness” of cream
or milk and their value depend upon the amount of
butter-fat in them. So cream or milk is often called
“30% cream” or “20% cream” or “4% milk” according
as 30% or 20% or 4% of the fluid is butter-fat; 30%
cream is quite rich; ordinary market cream varies between
18% and 40%, though it may fall below 18%, or it
may be sold as a very expensive article as high as 60%.
Rich milk may contain more than 6% of butter-fat and
skim milk less than 0.1 of one per cent. The average
for good whole milk is between 3% and 4½%.</p>

<p class='c014'>For a long time scientists and scientific dairymen
were the only ones to speak of milk and cream in terms
of percentage of butter-fat. Now, however, people are
beginning to realize how valuable a part of the milk
the butter-fat is and are paying more attention to the
actual percentage of butter-fat in the cream or milk
they use. So it is no longer unusual to see a dairyman
advertise cream of a certain percentage or to hear a
housewife ask for it specifically.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Standardizing Cream.</b>—For ice cream or for preparing
modified milk for babies, it is often desirable to
dilute rich cream to a certain lower standard. The
following simple steps can be taken to find out how
much milk to add for diluting:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>1. From the test—fat-percentage—of the rich cream
subtract the test desired.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. From the test desired subtract the test of the
milk used for diluting.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. Divide the first difference by the second, and the
result will be the number of pints (or pounds) of milk
to be added for each pint (or pound) of the rich cream.</p>

<p class='c014'>For instance, you may want to thin some 30% cream
to 10% for making ice cream. The milk to be added
is skim milk. Then:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. 30 - 10 = 20.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. 10 - 0 = 10.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. 20 divided by 10 = 2. So for each pint of rich
cream you may add 2 pints of skim milk.</p>

<p class='c014'>Or you may wish to thin the 30% cream with whole
milk, which has 4% butter-fat. Again:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. 30 - 10 = 20.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. 10 - 4 = 6.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. 20 divided by 6 = 3⅓. So you may add 3⅓
pints of the whole milk to each pint of the 30% cream
and still have a 10% cream.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Pasteurized Cream</b> does not look as rich as raw
cream, and fresh, sweet cream appears to be thinner
than when it is 24 hours old and slightly ripened. So
it is well, when buying cream, not to judge by appearances.
Demand of the milkman that he furnish you
cream of a certain percentage of butter-fat and see to
it that you get what you pay for. If you have no
Babcock tester the milk inspector will test the cream
for you.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Whipped Cream.</b>—For whipping, cream must be
fairly rich, from 24% to 32%, and it must be cold.
Fresh, sweet cream does not whip as readily as that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>which has been kept for 12 or 24 hours in ice water.
There is no other secret connected with the process.
Use a rich cream, suitably cooled and aged, and with
a good beater there can be no trouble in getting a fine,
stiff whipped cream. If the cream is too thin or too
warm it may not become stiff. Sometimes, when it
is beaten too long, it turns into butter and buttermilk.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c014'><b>Emulsified Cream.</b>—One of the recent additions to
the already elaborate machinery used in the creamery,
the milk supply or the ice cream business, is the <i>Emulsifier.</i>
To be sure, emulsifiers were used thirty to forty
years ago to mix animal and vegetable fats—oleomargarine
oil, lard and cottonseed oil—into skim milk
for “Filled Cheese” or for Butterine, but lately they
are serving new purposes in the milk industry. By forcing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>melted butter-fat or oil mixed with water or skim
milk through exceedingly small apertures under high
pressure, or otherwise breaking up the mixture, an
emulsion can be formed in which the fat globules are
much finer even than those in natural milk or cream,
and separation can be prevented. The force used in
these emulsifiers may be produced by powerful pumps,
or a steam jet, or centrifugal force under high speed;
whichever system is used the machines answer the same
purpose, to produce a permanent emulsion in which the
oil or fat will stay in suspension even after cooling. In
some milk supply plants and ice cream factories all the
cream is emulsified and the system has especially been
applied since the advent of the milk powder. It is now
a not infrequent practice to run the new milk through
the separator, make sweet, unsalted butter from the
cream, and milk powder from the skim milk, and to
ship or store these products separately where or until
cream is wanted and then bring them together again
by running them through the emulsifier with a suitable
amount of water. At first thought this process would
seem impractical and uneconomical. But it has proven
good business because in many cases and places skim
milk powder and butter keep better separately or can
be shipped at long distance to better advantage than
new milk or cream or condensed milk. In ice cream
factories business may be dull in cold weather and
cream is perhaps not provided and not available, when
suddenly a hot spell brings orders for large quantities.
With a stock of skim milk powder and butter on hand
in the refrigerator, and an emulsifier to mix these
products, cream can be produced on short notice and
there will be no danger of shortage.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>ICE CREAM</h3>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Ice cream has fast become the national dessert served
on all festive occasions, winter and summer. Originally
it meant a frozen mixture of sweetened and flavored
milk and cream, but the name has long been applied to
all kinds of frozen delicacies in which cream enters as
a constituent. Not even there has the line been drawn,
but gums, gelatine, cornstarch, eggs and other “fillers”
have been substituted or added to thicken the mixtures
and give “body” to “creams,” which have but little relation
to the genuine emulsion of butter-fat from cow’s
milk. Standardization has been attempted by National
and State food authorities with varying success of enforcement.
While the application of the name to a great
variety of frozen desserts has no doubt become legitimate
by long usage it may properly be demanded that
as an article of merchandise
“ice cream”
shall contain at least
8% to 12% butter-fat
and that no ingredients
dangerous
to health enter into
its manufacture.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Hand freezer</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c014'><b>Freezers.</b>—The
freezing is usually
done by contact of
the material with
metal cooled on the
other side by a
“freezing mixture” of salt and ice which produces
temperatures far below the freezing point of water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>while air is whipped into the cream by the rapid motion
of the beater. A great variety of excellent freezers of
this kind for hand or for power are on the market
which answer the purpose for making ice cream at
home or at the ice cream parlor.</p>

<p class='c014'>Coarse-grained salt and crushed ice, mixed in the
proportion of 1 part salt to 4 parts of ice, are constantly
filled into the space surrounding the ice cream can, and
the brine produced by the melting of the mixture is
gradually drawn off from the tub. In a good freezer
the operation should not take over fifteen minutes.
When the cream is frozen to a soft mush, stop the beater
and scrape down the hard particles which may have
accumulated on the sides of the can, add any ingredients
which may be better incorporated at this stage than
mixed into the original material, such as crushed fruit
or preserves, and finish the freezing without carrying
it too far.</p>

<p class='c014'>Remove the beater, stir the cream which should still
be soft enough to handle, and pack in ice with only a
little salt. Or the cream may be transferred from the
freezer can to the shipping can and packed in it. If
bricks are wanted the soft cream is packed in molds of
the desired shape and size and buried in the freezing
mixture to harden.</p>

<p class='c014'>In modern ice cream factories <i>Brine Freezers</i> are generally
used. In a <i>Refrigerator Plant</i> intensely low temperatures
are produced by the vaporizing of compressed
ammonia or carbonic acid in an ice machine, and brine
circulating in iron pipes is cooled by such medium and
may, in turn, cool the air in the <i>Cold Storage</i> room, or
the cream in the freezer, or pure water in metal boxes
for the manufacture of <i>Artificial Ice.</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>It has been attempted to make the brine freezers
<i>continuous</i>, the cream mixture being fed into the machine
at one end and discharged frozen at the other.
But this system has not so far been successful, and intermittent
or batch freezers are most practical yet
both for hand and for power.</p>

<p class='c014'>Rich material, frozen in a good machine, whether
intermittent or continuous, will expand from 50% to
100%, and the original material should not fill the
freezer can more than half full.</p>

<p class='c014'>The manufacture of ice cream has been the subject
of study and experiments for years in the Dairy Department
of the Agricultural College at Ames, Iowa,
where Professor M. Mortensen has worked out a comprehensive
classification from which any manufacturer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>may readily choose his formulas, modifying them to
suit his local conditions and special problems. The
outline kindly furnished the author by Professor Mortensen
is so interesting and instructive as to be well
worth copying substantially in full, leaving out the
“Ices” in which no milk or cream is used and which
are therefore not of special interest in connection with
the purpose of this book—the use of more and better
milk.</p>

<p class='c014'>Milk sherbets of various flavors may be prepared

<p class='c014'>The formulas presented above have been given
mainly for the purpose of making clear the difference
between the various groups. Numerous other formulas

<hr class='c032' />

<p class='c014'>Prof. Mortensen’s formulas are mostly made out for
ten gallons of ice cream. It is hardly necessary to call
attention to the fact that they can easily be adapted to
any smaller quantities by reducing each of the ingredients
alike. For instance, to make:</p>

<p><span class='small'>Professor Mortensen, behind the vat at the left, giving a lesson in the making of ice cream at Ames</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>It will be noticed that in the formulas worked out
at Ames as above, very rich cream is used,—with a
fat contents of 25% or 30%,—which makes exceedingly
rich ice creams and great expansion in freezing. The
ordinary ice cream maker will usually employ cheaper
material, mixing some milk in the cream and standardizing
the material to suit his local trade. Also most
housekeepers making ice cream at home will find it
convenient and economical to use a mixture of milk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>and cream and in doing so one must not expect so
much expansion.</p>

<p class='c014'>In many places outside of dairy sections cream is
scarce and <i>condensed milk</i> is substituted to a large
extent. Lately milk powder has come into use and
<i>Emulsified Cream</i> has become popular. Skim-milk
powder and unsalted butter may be kept in stock and
be available at any time, and by means of an <i>Emulsifier</i>
they are united again into a product identical with the
milk or cream from which they were originally separated.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Junket Ice Cream.</b>—By setting a mixture of milk
and cream with a solution of Junket Tablets and allowing
it to jelly before freezing, the body of the cream
may be improved so that a material of comparatively
low fat-percentage will make a very good ice cream,
rich enough for most people and especially well suited
for invalids and children. Ice-cold milk or cream is
rather hard to digest for a weak or delicate stomach
because the action of the rennet in the digestive juice
is imperfect and slow except at blood-temperature. In
Junket Ice Cream, however, such action takes place
before it is eaten and the digestive ferment of the
stomach is relieved of that function. For that reason
Junket Ice Cream is considered healthier than the
ordinary frozen products and may be indulged in freely
by children and invalids.</p>

<p class='c014'>The following are examples of tested Junket Ice
Creams:</p>

<h4 class='c024'>Vanilla Ice Cream</h4>

<p class='c030'>Dissolve two Junket Tablets in a tablespoonful of cold water, heat
two quarts of milk and one pint of cream lukewarm in which has
been dissolved one cup of sugar and two teaspoonfuls of vanilla
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>flavor, then add the dissolved Junket Tablet, stir quickly for one-half
minute and pour into ice cream can, let stand undisturbed ten
or fifteen minutes or until set. Pack with ice and salt and freeze.</p>

<h4 class='c024'>Pistachio Ice Cream</h4>

<p class='c022'>Excerpt from an article by Alice Bradley in “Woman’s Home
Companion”</p>

<p class='c030'>This is the best ice cream for the money that we know. It may
be made ready for the freezer early in the morning, and kept in the
ice box until it is convenient to freeze it. It is quite possible to
utilize cream that is not perfectly fresh.</p>

<p class='c031'>Put in the can of the freezer one pint of milk, one-half cup of heavy
cream, one-third cup sugar, one teaspoonful vanilla, one-half
teaspoon of almond extract, a few grains of salt, and vegetable
color paste to make a delicate green color. Set the freezer in a pan
of hot water. As soon as the mixture is lukewarm, add one Junket
Tablet dissolved in one tablespoon cold water. Mix thoroughly
and let stand until firm. Put in the ice box until ready to freeze,
then put can in the freezer tub, adjust the crank, put in three small
measures of ice that has been crushed in a heavy bag or shaved
fine with an ice shaver, cover this evenly with one measure of rock
salt, add three measures more of ice and one of salt, let stand five
minutes and then turn the crank of the freezer for about ten minutes,
when it may be turned a little more rapidly. Continue the turning
until the mixture is firm.</p>

<p class='c031'>Remove the dasher, pack ice cream solidly into the can, surround
with four measures of ice to one of salt, cover with heavy burlap
bag or newspaper and keep in a cold place until needed. Be sure
the opening in the side of the freezer tub is not plugged up, so that
any surplus of salt water will drain off instead of getting into the
freezer. It may be necessary to repack the freezer if the cream is
frozen very long in advance of the meal. The cream may be put
into a mold, set in the fireless cooker kettle, surrounded with ice
and salt and left in the fireless cooker all day. Peel peaches, cut in
thin slices, sprinkle with sugar and set in the ice box to chill. To
serve, place peaches in chilled dessert glasses, cover with ice cream
and garnish each with a candied cherry.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>In the following recipes the cream is added after the
junket prepared from mixtures of milk, sugar and
flavors has been partly frozen, a method which is
preferred by many.</p>

<h4 class='c024'>Coffee Ice Cream</h4>

<p class='c030'>Make a cup of very strong coffee, add it to two quarts of warm
milk in which one cup of sugar has been dissolved, taste in order to
see if the flavor is strong enough, add three dissolved Junket Tablets,
stir quickly for one-half minute, pour into ice cream can and let
stand undisturbed ten or fifteen minutes or until set. Pack with
ice and salt; freeze to a thick mush before adding one pint of
cream, then continue freezing.</p>

<h4 class='c024'><i>Simmons College Peach Ice Cream</i></h4>

<p class='c030'>Heat two quarts of milk lukewarm in which has been dissolved
one cup of sugar and two teaspoonfuls of vanilla flavor, add
two dissolved Junket Tablets, stir quickly for one-half minute and
pour into ice cream can, let stand undisturbed ten or fifteen minutes
or until set. Pack with ice and salt; freeze to a thick mush before
adding one pint of cream and crushed and sweetened peaches, then
continue freezing. Save the needed amount of peaches to serve on
top of ice cream.</p>

<p class='c022'>Frozen pudding, strawberries, bananas, or pineapple,
may be added in this way when making any Junket
Ice Cream.</p>

<h4 class='c024'><i>Orange Sherbet</i></h4>

<p class='c030'>Heat two quarts of milk lukewarm in which has been dissolved
two cups of sugar, then add two dissolved Junket Tablets, stir
quickly for a minute and pour into freezer can, let it stand ten or
fifteen minutes before packing with ice and salt; freeze to a thick
mush, then add juice and grated rind of six oranges and continue to
freeze.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span><b>Raspberry Sherbet</b> may be made in the same way by

and sweetened pineapple.</p>

<h4 class='c024'><i>Custard Ice Cream</i></h4>

<p class='c033'>When cream is scarce many housekeepers substitute a mixture
of eggs and milk. The following is a good standard recipe which
can be varied by using different fruits and flavors the same as in

  <h3 class='c010'>BUTTER</h3>
</div>

<p class='c022'>As everybody knows, butter is one of the oldest and
most important products of the dairy industry and
since the middle of the nineteenth century, when science
was first applied to it, the art of buttermaking has
gradually been developed to a high degree of perfection,
while the taste for fine butter has grown apace with its
manufacture.</p>

<p class='c014'>Between 1840 and 1850 the large estates in Holstein,
then connected with Denmark, were known for their
fine dairies and excellent butter, made in a practical
way without much attention to the reason for the
rules that were gradually worked out.</p>

<p class='c014'>A class of superior dairymaids was educated on these
large farms, many of whom were hired by progressive
farmers on the Danish islands where an effort was made
at that time to introduce better methods of dairying.</p>

<p class='c014'>The practical handicraft of these imported expert
dairymaids was supplemented and regulated by the
scientific work of Professor Segelcke and his pupils and
from the Sixties buttermaking became an art in Denmark
which was subjected to the most searching study
and improvements. Danish butter soon captured the
English market where previously Isigny (from Northern
France) and Dutch butter had commanded the highest
prices, and Danish sweet butter put up in sealed tin
cans also became known all over the world as the only
butter that would stand export to the Tropics.</p>

<p class='c014'>In this country Orange County, N.Y., first produced
a high-class article and, later, Elgin, Ill., became the
center that stood for the top of perfection. Thence
the industry soon spread over the middle western states,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>largely populated by Scandinavian immigrants many
of whom were skilled buttermakers, educated in the
old countries. Even up to this day it is noticeable that
the list of prize winning buttermakers at the National
Dairy Shows and other exhibitions is largely made up
of Scandinavian names. In Minnesota, for instance, as
fine butter is now made as anywhere in the world.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Dairy Butter.</i>—In the early days of the industry
butter was made at home on the farm. The milk was
set in shallow vessels,—in the Holstein and Danish
dairies in wooden tubs 24 inches in diameter placed
on the stone or concrete floor in the milk-vault, a cool
cellar partly underground,—or in tin pans on the
pantry shelf. After 36 to 48 hours the cream was
skimmed off with a flat scoop, often both cream and
skim milk being sour.</p>

<p class='c014'>About 1860 the deep tin can was introduced, set in
cold running water or, where ice was available, in ice
water. This was a great improvement over the shallow
setting system. It was now possible to raise most of
the cream in 24 hours leaving not to exceed ½%
butter-fat in the skim milk, and to have both cream
and skim milk sweet.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Centrifugal Creaming.</i>—But the climax of perfection
was not reached until the separator (see under Cream)
was invented about 1879 and cream was raised instantaneously.
For a long time it was the object of
the manufacturers to produce <i>power separators</i> of larger
and larger capacity, handling from 6,000 to 10,000
lbs. of milk an hour.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Co-operative Creameries</b> were established, taking in
20,000 lbs. of milk and more a day. But in thinly
settled sections where the roads were poor it was expensive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>to haul the milk a long distance to the creamery
and <i>hand separators</i> were introduced, each farmer skimming
his own milk fresh from the cows and delivering
the cream, only, to the creamery. This system has
the advantage of leaving the skim milk on the farm
in the very best condition for the calves and hogs and
of saving time and expenses in transportation. It has
the disadvantage that many farmers can hardly be
expected to handle all of these separators as skilfully
and cleanly as the creamery expert can run his one or
few machines, and consequently that the skimming is
more or less imperfect—more butter-fat being left in
the skim milk and more impurities in the cream than
in the whole-milk creamery. But in practice the advantages
of the hand separator and cream-gathering
system seem to be greater than the disadvantages and
it is rapidly taking the place of the whole-milk creameries.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Ripening the Cream.</i>—Butter may be made by
churning whole milk, but usually it is made from cream
that has been “ripened” or soured by standing for
about 10 hours at a temperature of from 65° to 75° F.
Modern buttermakers often pasteurize the cream and
then add a “starter” to sour it. By preparing the
starter with a pure culture of lactic acid bacteria
one can get the desired acidity and aroma, and exclude
undesirable flavors (as to Pure Cultures and
Starters, see under “Bacteria” and “Commercial Buttermilk”).</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Sanitary Cream Ripener showing coil swung up into cleaning position</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The process of ripening requires considerable skill
and attention and is one of the most delicate functions
the buttermaker is called upon to perform. In the
first place the cream must be faultless, sweet and pure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>before it is set to ripen, so the buttermaker will have
full control of the fermentation. For, if it is already
turned or partly fermented, no skill will avail to bring
it back to perfection. But with a first class, pure cream
the operator has it in his power to turn out perfect
butter. In the big western creameries cream is often
collected from farms at a distance of a hundred miles
or more and in warm weather such cream is likely to
arrive at the central plant in more or less advanced
condition. It is therefore difficult for the <i>centralizers</i>
to make really first-class butter while the “whole-milk
creamery” as well as the farmer handling his own
milk are in position to control the ripening from
the beginning,—starting with pure material and being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>able to develop the desired flavor and acidity in the
cream.</p>

<p class='c014'>After adding the starter to the cream it must be kept
at a uniform temperature of 65 to 75° during the ripening
process and it must be watched carefully and occasionally
stirred gently until the consistency, aroma
and acidity are as desired. Then it should be cooled
quickly to stop further fermentation and if it is not to
be churned at once it should be kept cold until churning
time. Usually it is safer to set the cream in the morning
and hasten the ripening so it will be completed in the
evening rather than to leave it overnight warm. For,
if it is finished in the evening, the cream may be cooled
and placed in ice water overnight and one is sure to
have it in good condition for churning in the morning.
But it is quite feasible for the experienced operator to
regulate the process so the cream will not be fully
ripened in the morning until he is on hand to watch it
and see that the process does not go too far. Taste
and smell will tell when it is just right, and the <i>acid
test</i> may also be applied to determine when to stop
the fermentation. An acidity of .5% is usually desired.
When the condition is right, chill the cream, cooling it
to below 50°—preferably down towards 40°—and leave
it in ice water or in the refrigerator until churning time;
then temper it to the proper temperature for churning.</p>

<p class='c014'>Even if it is to be churned soon after the ripening
is completed it is best to chill it and then raise the
temperature to the point wanted for churning. This
gives a better “grain” and “body” to the butter than
if the ripened cream is just cooled to the churning
temperature, and is especially desirable when the cream
has been pasteurized.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c014'><b>Coloring.</b>—When the cream is ready it is poured into
the churn and a little butter color is added. Some
people prefer butter very light or even uncolored, but
usually 1 to 2 teaspoonfuls of a standard butter color<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c017'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
to 10 gallons of cream will be found right, varying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>according to the season and the breed of cows furnishing
the milk. The butter-fat in Guernsey and Jersey
milk is naturally highly colored, while that in Holstein
milk is comparatively white. When the cows are on
fresh pasture in the early summer the butter-fat is
more highly colored than when they are on dry food.
The amount of coloring to be added to the cream is
regulated to overcome such variations and make the
butter of uniform color all the year round.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Churning.</b>—Hundreds of varieties of churns have
been constructed from time to time; 2,000 years ago
Pliny described the old dash churn much the same as
still occasionally used on the farm, and the principle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>involved in the process has not been changed. The
object is to make the fat globules conglomerate into
grains that can be collected and leave as little butter-fat
as possible in the buttermilk.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The best temperature for churning varies from 48°
to 56° and must be determined by local conditions and
experience.  To allow plenty
of room for the cream to
shake about, the churn should not be much more than
half full. When the globules of fat suspended in the
milk stick together and form granules as large as good
sized pin-heads it is time to stop the churn and drain
off the buttermilk. If the butter fails to “come” in
half an hour or forty minutes it may be because the
cream in the churn is too warm or too cold. A little
cold or warm water, as the case may be, can be added
as a simple remedy.</p>

<p><span class='small'>Churning room in a large modern creamery</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Toward the end of the process care must be taken
that the churn is stopped at the right moment, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the butter will separate clear from the buttermilk.
After the buttermilk is drawn off pure cold water is
poured into the churn and the butter granules are
rinsed in it. This water again is drawn off and fresh
cold water put in.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><b>Working the Butter.</b>—The butter can now be taken
out with a sieve and worked on the butter-worker, or
it may be worked in the churn. “Working” the butter
consists in squeezing out the buttermilk and kneading
the butter into a smooth but not “greasy” mass. If
it is too warm and if it is worked too much, with a
sliding motion instead of just pressing, the butter is
apt to become greasy. If there seems to be any danger
of greasiness, it is better to stop and put the butter
in a cool place for a few hours to recover its elasticity.
The working can then be finished safely.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span><b>Salting.</b>—During this working process salt is added
and thoroughly distributed and worked in. About half
an ounce of salt is used for a pound of butter.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Composition of Butter.</b>—When finished, the butter
ought not to contain more than 12% to 15% of water,
and there should be at least 80% of butter-fat. If all
the butter-fat originally in the milk could be taken out
in the butter, 100 lbs. of 4% milk should yield 4.88%
(4.88 lbs.) of butter with 82% butter-fat. But a little
is lost in the skim milk and more in the buttermilk,
which usually contains ½% fat, so that about 4½
lbs. is all the butter that can be expected from 100 lbs.
of milk.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Overrun.</b>—Creamery men are much interested in the
“Overrun” which means the increase from the churn
over the amount of fat in the milk. For instance, if a
quantity of milk containing 100 lbs. butter-fat as shown
by the Babcock Test produces 114 lbs. of finished
butter, the overrun is 14%. The buttermaker who
gets the largest overrun by reducing the loss of butter-fat
in the skim milk and the buttermilk to a minimum,
keeping the percentage of water in the butter just
below 16%, and yet producing high scoring butter, is
considered most efficient.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Packing.</b>—For the market, butter is packed in tubs
or stone jars. Or it is molded in neat one-pound bricks
and wrapped in parchment paper.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Sweet Butter.</b>—Real “sweet” butter is churned from
fresh, sweet, unsoured cream. But usually the name
is given to the <i>unsalted</i> and <i>uncolored</i> butter that
many people relish. Without the salt it does not keep
as well as ordinary butter, and must be eaten quite
fresh. Well-made salted butter will keep for months
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>with ordinary care, and in cold storage it may be kept
a year. But when it comes out of cold storage it must
be used within a few weeks, for butter, like other cold
storage foods, will soon spoil and become rancid when
it is exposed to a higher temperature for any length of
time.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Renovated Butter.</b>—Butter that has become old and
rancid can be “renovated.” The butter is melted and
the butter-oil washed,—aërated in the renovating
plants,—and then churned with fine-flavored sour skim
milk. From the sour skim milk it gets back its old
butter flavor. The granular physical consistency of
fresh butter is gained by pouring the emulsified mixture
over cracked ice or into ice water. By the time the
excess of “buttermilk” has been removed by working,
and salt has been mixed in, the renovated butter may
be almost as good as fresh creamery butter.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Oleomargarine</b> or <b>Butterine</b> is made in much the same
way. A mixture of beef-fat (the soft part of beef-tallow)
and lard and cottonseed oil is churned with
sour milk and worked and granulated like renovated
butter. For the better grades, some of the finest
creamery butter is mixed with it, so that the mixture
can hardly be distinguished from real butter.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Coco-butter</b>, <b>Nut-butter</b>, etc., in great variety, are now
also on the market as substitutes for butter, all prepared
in a similar way, but lacking the vital unknown
element that makes genuine butter so superior to
substitutes.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>BUTTERMILK</h3>

<p class='c022'>If the cream has been carefully ripened, with or
without a pure culture starter, and it has shown the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>proper sourness when churned, the buttermilk will be
of a pleasing taste and flavor. Its thickness will of
course depend upon the amount of water, if any, added
to the cream in the churn during the buttermaking.
If the buttermilk is to be used for human food care
must be taken not to dilute it too much.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Cooling Essential.</b>—If buttermilk is left to stand for
hours in a warm room, fermentation goes on and may
soon spoil the buttermilk by making it sloppy or bitter.
It should therefore be cooled at once when drawn from
the churn; if kept in ice water it may remain in fine
flavor for several days. Well taken care of it is not
only a pleasing and refreshing drink but eminently
healthful. In cooking, too, it can be used to advantage.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Commercial Buttermilk</b> or <b>Cultured Milk</b> is simply carefully
soured milk. It can be made at home from fresh
milk either whole or skimmed or partly skimmed. Partially
skimmed milk containing from 1% to 2% butter-fat
is plenty rich enough and even better for most purposes
than whole milk. The essential qualities of good
buttermilk depend upon the proper ripening of the
cream or milk, the development of a pure “breed” of
healthful bacteria in a clean field free from weeds. Such
a plantation or “culture” may be grown in milk as
well as in cream. Its function is to turn the sugar of
milk into lactic acid under the development of pleasing
flavors and whether the butter-fat is removed by the
separator or by churning makes little difference. In
natural buttermilk there is always a little butter-fat—at
least ½%—left, mostly in the form of fine granules,
too small to be retained in the butter. If the same
amount of butter-fat is left in skim milk and that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>ripened and churned, the product will be identically
the same as natural buttermilk from ripened cream.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Ripening.</b>—For best result the milk should be pasteurized,
not necessarily as thoroughly as for starters,
but sufficiently so as to destroy all obnoxious bacteria
and give those introduced through a pure culture
starter a chance to grow. Buttermilk may, however,
also be made from good, clean, unpasteurized milk of
good flavor. Whether pasteurized or not the milk is
set to ripen with from 5 to 10% starter at a temperature
of from 65 to 75°. The preparation of starters is described
under “Bacteria” and the ripening of the milk
for “buttermilk” is essentially the same process (see
also under <i>Ripening</i> of cream for butter). When ripened
to the desired acidity,—say .5% to .6% by the
acid test,—stop further fermentation by thorough
cooling.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Breaking up the Curd.</b>—After cooling, the ripened
milk may be broken up fine and if vigorously shaken
or “churned” it will remain smooth and creamy. Otherwise
it may separate into curd and whey. If churned
long enough for the butter to form, it becomes absolutely
identical with real buttermilk. But, for all
practical purposes, a vigorous shaking for a few minutes
is enough.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Thick Milk.</b>—“Thick Milk” as eaten in Scandinavia
is made in the same way as commercial buttermilk,
except that the milk—rich whole milk—is set to
ripen in the bowl in which it is to be served. Instead
of being churned or stirred, it is left thick, to be served
as a pudding, like Junket made from sweet milk. The
rich layer of cream that forms on top is excellent.
“Thick Milk” is eaten plain with the oatmeal for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>breakfast, or as a dessert with grated stale bread and
sugar spread over it.</p>

<p class='c014'>The uses of buttermilk in making pancakes and for
many other culinary purposes are mentioned in the
chapter on “Milk Cookery.”</p>

Metchnikoff, the late director of

people living to exceptional old age
which he ascribed to the fact that
their principal diet is sour milk of
very high acidity.</p>

<p class='c014'>The theory is that a luxurious
growth of lactic acid bacilli, acting
as a germicide, destroys other fermentations
in the lower intestines.
The bacilli active in Yoghourt require
a somewhat higher temperature
for their best growth than the
lactic acid bacilli predominant in sour cream for the
finest butter, a fact which must be taken into consideration
in preparing the various products.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the preparation of Koumis, Kefir and other fermented
milks of the same class, Yeast plays an important
part, changing some of the milk-sugar into the
alcohol which is found in these preparations in quantities
up to 2%.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Koumis</b> was first made from mare’s milk by the Tartars,

and may be regarded both as a food and a stimulant.
It is sometimes prescribed by physicians in cases when
the patient cannot retain other food.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Kefir</b> is a similar preparation originally made in the
Caucasus by a fermentation started by Kefir grains
which contain both yeast and various bacteria. The
dry Kefir grains are soaked, first in lukewarm water,
later in lukewarm milk, for several days, until they
develop so much gas as to float on the top. A couple
of tablespoonfuls of the grains are then added to a
quart of milk which is left to ferment at 70° F. under
frequent stirring or shaking. When the fermentation
is fully developed the grains are strained off and the
milk is bottled and kept for 1 to 2 days at 60°. The
grains may be used at once again in fresh milk, and
when the manufacture is finished they may be dried
and kept, to be used again another time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Most of the following pages on <i>Cheese</i> were published
in 1918 as a separate pamphlet to meet an urgent demand
for brief directions along this line during the
Food Conservation campaign. The copy has, however,
been revised and new material has been added
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>with the view of making this chapter more useful to
those who desire to study in detail the manufacture
of various fancy foreign types of cheese such as Edam,
Swiss, Brick, Roquefort, etc., which are now made in
this country in constantly increasing quantities.</p>

<p class='c014'>For more complete directions in cheese making
students are referred to “A B C in Cheese Making”
by J. H. Monrad, and other technical works.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cheese of a thousand different kinds is made, varying
in properties and appearance from the solid, yet mellow
and agreeable Cheddar cheese to the semi-soft, malodorous
Limburger, the delicious, soft Neufchatel and
Cream cheese, or the sweet Myseost of Norway. In
India cheese was made centuries ago; to-day it is produced
the world over, in the caves of the Swiss Alps and
in the most modern and scientific American cheese
factories and laboratories. Of these myriad types we
can here describe only a few.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cheese may be classified into that made with rennet
and that made without. Of cheese made with rennet
some is what is called hard, some soft.</p>

<p class='c014'>The English and American <i>Cheddar</i>—the common
<i>American cheese</i>—the <i>Dutch Gouda</i> and <i>Edam</i>, the
Swiss <i>Gruyere</i>, and the Italian <i>Parmesan</i> are all hard
cheese made with rennet. As examples of the soft
varieties may be mentioned the French <i>Camembert</i> and
<i>Brie</i>, <i>Cream</i> and <i>Neufchatel</i> cheese. In a class by themselves
are such cheeses as the French <i>Roquefort</i>, the
English <i>Stilton</i>, and the Italian <i>Gorgonzola</i>, their peculiar
flavors being derived from molds implanted in the
curd.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i088.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c014'>When cheese is made without rennet, the milk is
allowed to curdle by natural acidity or it is in some other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>way made acid. Among the varieties made by this
method the common <i>Cottage</i> cheese is the best known.</p>

<p class='c014'>For many years imitations of foreign varieties such as
Swiss and Limburger have been made in Northern New
York and Wisconsin. As a result of the war and the
cutting off of foreign cheese imports, the State of Wisconsin
has built up a large business in these fancy varieties.
New types have lately been added, as the
<i>Romano</i>, <i>Riggiano</i>, and <i>Myzethra</i>, which are of Italian
and Greek origin. Some of these are made of whole
milk, some of partly-skimmed milk, and others of the
albumin of the whey.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us briefly review the characteristic features in
the making of the older types.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>CHEDDAR CHEESE</h3>

<p class='c022'>For a hundred years or more this famous cheese has
been made and marketed at the village of Cheddar near
Bristol, England.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the middle of the nineteenth century a farmer in
that neighborhood, Joseph Harding of Marksbury Vale,
systematized the manufacture and it was his method
that became the model for cheesemaking in America.
In this country it was first made in Herkimer County,
N.Y., where Harry Burrell not only made cheese for
the home market, but also exported to England, and
his son, David H. Burrell, at Little Falls later developed
the machinery which became the standard for the
American and Canadian cheese factories.</p>

<p class='c014'>The factory system by which cheese was made from
milk brought together from several farms, originated
near Rome, N.Y., and soon cheesemaking became an
important industry throughout Central and Northern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>New York whence it spread into Pennsylvania, Ohio
and the West, as well as to Canada. To-day Wisconsin
makes more cheese than all the other states together
and Canada largely supplies England with Cheddar
cheese of excellent quality.</p>

<p class='c022'>The milk is delivered in the morning by the farmers
at the factory and is weighed and strained through
cheese-cloth into the cheese vat. When it is all in the
vat it is warmed to a temperature of 86° F. by letting
steam into the water surrounding the bottom and sides
of the jacketed vat.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Ripening.</b>—The milk should be slightly acid, not
noticeably sour, yet sufficiently ripened for the proper
fermentation to take place in the process that follows.
The best cheesemakers regulate the ripening by adding
a starter to the sweet milk and allowing the lactic acid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>bacteria to multiply in the milk until a <i>Rennet Test</i><a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c017'><sup>[6]</sup></a> or
<i>Acid Test</i><a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c017'><sup>[7]</sup></a> shows that the desired degree of acidity has
been reached. The starter may be sour whey or preferably
prepared from sweet skim milk or whole milk
with a commercial lactic acid culture as described in
Chapter <a href='#ch01'>I</a> under <i>Ferments</i> and <i>Buttermilk</i>. From 1% to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>2% starter is usually sufficient. An acidity of .18% to
.20% or 2½ degrees on the Rennet Test is usually desired
before the rennet is added.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'><b>Adding Color and Rennet.</b><a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c017'><sup>[8]</sup></a>—If the cheese is to be
colored, from 1 to 2 ounces of liquid cheese color (Annatto
dissolved in an alkali) per 1,000 lbs. of milk is now
added and thoroughly mixed into the milk which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>then set with rennet. Three ounces of a standard rennet
extract to 1,000 lbs. of milk is usually sufficient.
Enough should be used so that the milk will show beginning
coagulation in 10 to 15 minutes and be ready to
cut in 30 to 40 minutes.</p>

<div class='fn'>

</div>

<p class='c014'>The extract should be diluted with ten times as much
water and is then poured into the milk under vigorous
stirring so as to be thoroughly distributed and incorporated
in the whole mass.</p>

<p class='c014'>Owing to the scarcity of the raw material for rennet
extract during the war, pepsin extracted from hogs’
stomachs has been substituted in many factories and is
used either in dry form or as a liquid extract instead
of rennet extract.</p>

<p class='c014'>With pepsin as the coagulant it is necessary to ripen
the milk somewhat further than if rennet is used, in
fact to the danger-point where a little more acidity is
apt to do harm and produce a dry and crumbly cheese
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>and loss of butter-fat in the whey. Most cheesemakers
therefore prefer rennet when they can get it.</p>

<p class='c014'>The rennet having been added, the milk is left undisturbed
until a firm curd has been formed. When
the curd breaks or splits sharply before the finger
pushed slowly through it, it is ready to be “cut.”</p>

<div  class='figleft id002'>
<img src='images/i094.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Curd knives</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c014'><b>Cutting.</b>—Two sets of curd knives are used, each
consisting of a metal frame in which tinned steel blades
are hung, in one vertically
and in the other horizontally.
The vertical knife is first carried
slowly through the curd
lengthwise and crosswise; the
horizontal set of blades is
then moved carefully through
the length of the vat. When
the cutting is over, the entire
mass should be in cubes about
half an inch square.</p>

<p class='c014'>The whey that begins to
separate out should be clear
and yellow. Milky whey is a
sign that the butter-fat is escaping
in it; the curd has
been broken up too violently.
In curdling, the casein encases
the butter-fat and the object of the breaking up of
the curd in the vat is to expel the whey but retain the
fat in the cheese.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>“Cooking” the Curd.</b>—Gentle heat is now applied to
raise the temperature gradually to 98° or 100° in the
course of about 30 minutes. Meanwhile the small
pieces of curd are kept floating in the whey by gentle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>stirring with a rake and the hands, and are not allowed
to pack at the bottom of the vat. The heating is easily
regulated by opening the steam valve little by little.
Through the “cooking” the pieces of curd shrink to
some extent and are hardened so that they will gradually
stand livelier stirring without losing butter-fat.
After the cooking the curd is left for an hour or so in
the whey for a slight acidity to develop and it is then
shoved toward the sides of the vat and the whey is
drained off. Here again the “Acid Test” may assist
in determining when the whey should be drawn.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Cheddaring or Matting.</b>—After thorough draining,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the curd is packed together in the bottom of the vat or
on a “sink” provided with a false bottom covered with
cheese-cloth. After fermenting for 10 or 15 minutes it
is cut into large pieces which are again packed together
for further matting. The exact condition to be attained
can be determined only by experience.</p>

<p><span class='small'>“Cheddaring” or “Matting” the curd</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>A simple test, the “Hot Iron Test,” may, however,
help the cheesemaker to judge of this point. A handful
of curd squeezed together and touched to a hot
steam pipe or an iron rod heated almost red-hot in
the fire under the boiler, and slowly withdrawn, will
leave threads sticking to the iron. Depending upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>maturity of the curd, the threads will break at a length
of from ½ to 2 inches. Usually fermentation is considered
sufficient when threads 1½ inches long are
formed by this test.</p>

<p><span class='small'>Curd mill</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c014'><b>Salting.</b>—The matting is then interrupted by breaking
up and salting
the curd. This
can be done by
hand or by a
curd-mill which
cuts or breaks
up the curd and
permits a thorough
mixing in
of the salt. Two
or three pounds
of salt to one
hundred pounds of curd, or the curd from 1,000 lbs. of
milk, is the usual ratio.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Pressing.</b>—Stirring and cooling the salted curd to
about 80° F. makes it ready for packing into the hoops
in which it is to be pressed. The hoop is usually a
cylinder of heavy tin with a “follower” of wood on
which the pressure is applied. Before the curd is put
in, the hoop is lined with cheese-cloth which remains
on the cheese, when it is taken out. The press mostly
used in the factory is the continuous pressure “gang-press”
in which a number of cheeses can be pressed at
the same time.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Curing.</b>—After 18 hours’ pressure the cheese is taken
out of the press and out of the hoop, weighed and placed
on a shelf or table in the curing room. For the first
week or ten days it is kept at a temperature of about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>70°, later the cheese is removed to a cooler room and
possibly placed in cold storage. Usually it is paraffined
to prevent too much drying and cracking of the rind.</p>

<p class='c014'>To cure a first-class Cheddar cheese takes from three
to six months, but most of the American cheese is made
to cure much more quickly and is eaten two to four
months old. Indeed, it is generally shipped from the
factory eight to ten days old and whatever further
curing it gets is in the warehouse of the commissionman
or in the grocery store.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>The Gang press</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c014'><b>Form, Size and Packing.</b>—The old style American
cheese is cylindrical, about 14 inches in diameter, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>varying in depth to weigh between 60 and 80 pounds.
Various other forms are now often made, square and
long or in fancy shapes, such as a ball or a pineapple.
Aside from such freaks, which have never become very
popular, other deviations from the large, standard,
American Cheddar, are also made to a considerable
extent. People who have visited the beautiful National
Dairy Shows held in turn in Chicago, Springfield, Mass.,
and Columbus, O., the National Milk and Dairy Farm
Expositions of New York City, the Ontario Provincial
Fair held each year at Toronto, or the annual State
Fairs in New York, Wisconsin, Michigan and other
cheesemaking sections will have in mind first the prominent
exhibits of the regular Cheddar, showing a uniformity
in texture, form and taste that is really remarkable.
But one will also admire the variety of other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>forms. There are the <i>Flats</i> or <i>Twins</i>, packed two in a
box and weighing together the same as one <i>American</i>;
the <i>Young Americas</i> packed four in a box; the <i>Longhorns</i>
of six to eight inches in diameter; others made like a loaf
of bread and creased so that a pound or two may be
cut off fairly accurately, etc.</p>

<p class='c014'>The <i>Giant Cheeses</i>, weighing five to six tons, occasionally
exhibited and cut up at World Fairs and on
similar occasions are, like the pineapple cheese, a curiosity
rather than an industrial product.</p>

<p class='c014'>One of the best forms, in the writer’s opinion, is the
small 5-lb. cheese, proportioned exactly like the large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>American. This makes a suitable size for an average
family, the members of which have learned to appreciate
a good cheese. If it is made smaller, too much is
lost in the rind; if larger it gets too old before it can be
consumed by one family.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The larger cheeses are usually packed in neat, snug-fitting
elm-wood boxes, with thin “Scale Boards” on
the top and bottom of the cheese, the smaller ones in
paraffined pressed pulp or pasteboard boxes.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Cleaning the Vats and Utensils.</b>—Like every other
place where milk and its products are handled, the
cheese factory must be kept scrupulously clean. Vats
and utensils should be rinsed first with cold or lukewarm
water or whey, then scrubbed with boiling hot water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>and if necessary with soda, soap, or washing powder.
The surroundings should be kept neat and attractive,
and the cheesemaker must see that the transportation
cans are kept clean by the farmers
and the milk delivered in
good condition.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Cheese box</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c014'><b>Yield.</b>—The yield is around
10% of the milk. To make a
pound of fresh cheese takes
from nine to eleven pounds of
milk. In curing, a part of the
weight is lost by evaporation,
but this loss is reduced to a
minimum by paraffining.</p>

<p class='c014'>In some localities an increased
yield is obtained by washing the
curd and making it absorb all
the water it can hold. The process is not commendable
and while it may sell to some extent, in certain markets
where a soft, fresh cheese is liked, “washed” or
“soaked” curd cheese can never compare favorably in
quality with a well-made, firm Cheddar cheese that is
mellowed down by long-time curing to a consistency so
it will fairly melt in your mouth.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Composition.</b>—The American cheese contains almost
all the casein and the butter-fat of the milk, besides
such portions of the milk-albumin, milk-sugar, and
mineral matter as are held in the water or whey which
is retained in the cheese. In round figures average
American cheese contains equal parts of casein, butter-fat
and water, 30 to 35% of each. In order to protect
the honest maker and the consumer and prevent
“soaking” of the curd to an extent that may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>considered fraudulent, the dairy laws of the State of
New York limit the contents of water permissible to
40% and 42% respectively for certain classes of cheese.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Qualities.</b>—A good Cheddar cheese should be mellow,
yet solid, without holes, and of an agreeable taste,
neither sharp nor bitter. Cheese can be made of skim
milk, but it is hardly palatable. In the fall of the year,
when the average milk is rich in butter-fat, 1% or 2%
butter-fat may be taken from the milk and the resulting
partly-skimmed milk will still make a fairly
good cheese, hardly distinguishable from full cream
cheese. Under the laws of the State of New York it
must, however, be marked “Skim Milk Cheese.”</p>

<h4 class='c024'>Cheese Made from Pasteurized Milk</h4>

<p class='c022'>From time to time attempts have been made to make
Cheddar cheese from pasteurized milk. If the milk
is heated to 145° only, and held for 30 minutes at such
temperature, its property to form a firm curd with
rennet is not destroyed and it will make a fine cheese,
but if it is pasteurized at a higher temperature it will
not curdle firmly until it is ripened or otherwise brought
back to the condition required for satisfactory action
of the rennet ferment. Thorough ripening with a pure
culture starter will do it, or an addition of muriatic
acid will accomplish the same in a shorter time, but
care must be taken not to use too much, which would
make the cheese dry and crumbly. Dr. J. L. Sammis
and A. T. Bruhn of the Wisconsin Dairy School worked
out the problem and systematized a process which is described
in Bulletin 165 of the U. S. Department of Agriculture
and by which it is claimed a first-class cheese can
be made regularly from thoroughly pasteurized milk.</p>

tub or any other convenient vessel. The double bottomed
vat generally used in American as well as in
Danish dairies facilitates
both the heating
of the milk before setting
and the “cooking”
of the curd in
the whey after cutting.
Either low pressure
steam, or—better—water
heated by steam,
is introduced in the
space between the outer, wooden bottom and the inner,
tinned steel or copper bottom. If it is cool the milk
should be warmed to 86° F. In the summer it may be
warm enough as it comes in, fresh from the cow. If
not, heat it by steam or by setting it in a “shot-gun”
can in another vessel of hot water, stirring frequently,
until the thermometer shows 86°. It may be well to
add a little buttermilk or sour whey from the preceding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>day, or a pure culture starter made with Buttermilk

<p><span class='small'>Gouda cheese</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c014'><b>Gouda Cheese.</b>—The <i>Gouda</i>, like the <i>Danish Export</i>
cheese, is made from whole or partly-skimmed milk
which is set with rennet at 90° F. and is coagulated,
ready for cutting, in fifteen to twenty minutes. The
curd is broken with the “lyre,” so called, a frame on
which piano wires are suspended.
The curd is but slightly “cooked”
and the whey is drawn while still
sweet. After being pressed with
the hands in the vat to squeeze
out the whey the curd, still quite
warm, is put into wooden molds and worked and
squeezed in them with the hands for half an hour to
eliminate more whey, when the mold is placed in a
regular press for 12 to 18 hours. To salt it the cheese
is placed in a strong brine where it remains for several
days. It is then put on the shelf in the
curing room where it is turned and
rubbed daily and in four to six weeks it
is marketed. The cheese is about 10
inches in diameter by 4 to 5 inches
high.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'><b>Edam Cheese.</b>—The ball-shaped red
<i>Edam</i> is also made in Holland by a
similar method to that of the Gouda.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fresh milk is set at from 90° to
93° F. in summer and up to 97° in winter,—colored
to a rather high yellow
with Annatto. Add sufficient rennet to coagulate the
milk in 8 to 15 minutes. Cut curd carefully with the
“lyre” and break with fork into very fine pieces, as
small peas. Leave to settle for 3 to 4 minutes, putting
cover on the vat if the temperature in the room is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>below 60°. When settled, the curd is gently pushed
into a heap which takes 5 to 6 minutes and the whey
is removed with a dipper. Weight is applied for 5
minutes and the tub or vat is tipped so the whey will
drain off while the curd is held back with the dipper.
This pressing is repeated twice more for 4 and 3 minutes
respectively.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Curing room in a Gouda cheese factory</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The curd should now be elastic and firm and show a
temperature, in winter of at least 83°, in summer at
most 90°. If necessary the temperature is regulated
by pouring hot whey (not exceeding 104°) or cold water
over the curd.</p>

<p class='c014'>The mold is then placed in the vat and two handfuls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>of curd put in which is squeezed and worked thoroughly
with the hands. More curd is added and worked in
the same way and this is repeated until the mold is
full with a large top on, which is pressed with the hands
for 4 or 5 minutes, turning the cheese 3 or 4 times and
opening the drain holes if plugged up. Some makers
sprinkle a teaspoonful of fine salt in the bottom of the
mold, but in warm weather it is better
to work in a quarter of an ounce of salt.
This work must be done quickly so the
curd will not cool.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Mold for Edam cheese</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>When thus formed the cheese is dipped
for 1 or 2 minutes in fresh whey heated
to 126° (in winter 131°) and pressed with
the hands in the mold for another 2
minutes when it is carefully wiped off by
rolling on a fine cloth to remove the last
drop of whey. The cheese is then wrapped in a
fine cloth, placed in the mold and put to press, in
the Spring for 5 to 7 hours, later in the year for
12 hours. The cloth is now removed and the cheese
is put in a larger mold which is placed in a water-tight
salting box provided with a cover and a drain-hole
in one end. The first day a pinch of salt is put
on the top of the cheese and the next the whole cheese
is rolled in damp salt, turned and put back in the mold,
a liberal quantity of salt being placed on the top. This
is repeated every day until the cheese from being soft
and elastic becomes hard which as a rule takes 8 to 10
days for a 4 lb. and 12 days for a 10-12 lb. cheese.
Finally the cheese is left a few hours in the brine collected
in the box, washed, wiped and placed on the
shelf in the curing room.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>The curing room should be light and well ventilated,
never above 72° nor below 45°. Windows must not be
opened to admit dry wind or moist air. If too dry the
cheese will crack and if too moist it will be covered with
deleterious yellowish red fungi. The cheese is turned
daily the first month, later every other day or twice a
week. When 24 to 30 days old the cheese is soaked for
one hour in water of 68 to 77°, washed with a brush,
dried for 20 to 40 minutes in the sun and returned to
the shelf. This is repeated two weeks later and then
the cheese is painted with linseed oil and left on the
shelf until shortly before shipping when it is scraped
with a sharp knife and painted according to the demand
of the particular market for which it is prepared; yellowish
with Annatto for England and Spain, red with
Turnsole for other countries. When dry it is rubbed
with a little butter and red color.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Swiss Cheese.</b>—The Swiss Gruyere or Emmenthal
also belongs to this class. It is characterized by its
form and size, being large, round and flat, weighing 100
to 140 lbs. or more, and by the large holes which are
wanted in Swiss, but not tolerated in American or
Dutch cheese. It was formerly supposed that first-class
Swiss cheese could only be made in the Alps, but
very good imitations have long been made in Northern
New York and in Wisconsin. Besides in the usual
large round form, the same as the genuine imported
Emmenthaler, American Swiss or “Switzer” is also
made in <i>blocks</i>, six inches square and twenty inches
long, weighing 25 to 30 lbs.</p>

<p class='c014'>Until lately Swiss cheese has been made in the old-fashioned
way, the factory and tools being of the
simplest description. The milk was heated in a copper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>cauldron hanging on a crane, enabling the cheesemaker
to swing it on or off the fireplace. Nowadays the kettle
is usually jacketed and heated with steam. The round
form is still preferred to the American cheese vat, however,
as it adapts itself better to the peculiar method
of handling the curd.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Swiss cheese</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The milk is set with rennet at a temperature of 90°
F. in summer and 95° in winter, sufficient rennet being
used to make a firm curd in thirty to forty minutes.
But very little color is added. The curd is cut with a
long, sharp wooden knife, the “cheese sword,” first one
way into sheets, then, as soon as the cuts stand clear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>beginning to expel the whey, crossways, into vertical
sticks, two inches square.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Tools for stirring the curd</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>No horizontal knife is used, but a few minutes after
the last vertical cutting the curd is further broken by
the “scoop,” a wooden spoon or ladle about eight inches
long, thirteen inches wide, one and one-half inches
deep, and provided with a short handle. Standing at
one side of the kettle, the cheesemaker scoops off a
layer from the top and, drawing the scoop towards
himself, drops the pieces of curd close to the side of
the kettle. This movement is repeated, at first slowly,
then faster, and soon the whole mass of curd is moving,
the pieces cut off going down along the side of the
kettle and the rest of the sticks sliding upward along
the other side, to be attacked by the scoop as soon as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>they come to the top. All the curd having been cut
into square pieces, it is further broken by the stirrer,
a stick at the lower end of which a few cross sticks or
wings of brass wire are fixed, the whole mass being
kept in constant motion.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Cooking the Curd.</b>—After breaking up the curd to
the size of peas or beans, the stirring is discontinued
for about ten minutes, when it is begun again and the
kettle is turned over the fire, or steam is applied, to
heat the curd to 140° under constant stirring which is
continued for 45 to 60 minutes after this temperature
has been reached. The condition of the curd is judged
by squeezing a handful and noticing its elasticity and
consistency. It is important to stop stirring at the
right moment. More whey is expelled in making Swiss
cheese than for Cheddar cheese.</p>

<p class='c014'>The cooking and agitating having been finished, the
mass, which now consists of grains the size of wheat, is
once more stirred up with such force as to make it
form a funnel at the center and it is then left at rest
for five to ten minutes.</p>

<p class='c014'>The curd, forming a rather solid cake at the bottom
of the kettle, is now lifted out without being broken.
One end of a large piece of cloth is folded around a
flexible rod. Bending over the kettle the maker takes
hold of both ends of the rod and gathering the other
end of the cloth between his teeth, pushes the rod down
along the farther side of the kettle, letting it follow the
bottom towards himself until the whole mass of curd
is gathered in the cloth, when it is lifted out of the kettle
and placed in the hoop on the press table. The hoop
can be enlarged or diminished to take care of a varying
amount of curd which is put into it in the same solid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>cake as formed in the kettle without being broken.
Pressure is applied, at first, gently, later heavier and
after half an hour the cheese is taken out, turned and
provided with fresh bandage, put back into press and
left till the next day.</p>

<p class='c014'>Curing and Salting.—The cheese is first placed in a
curing room above ground and heated in winter. After
a few weeks it is removed to the cellar. Sometimes
three to five cheese are piled one on the top of the
other for a few days with a few handfuls of salt between
them. The salting proper is done by rubbing and
brushing dry salt and the brine formed from same into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>the cheese,—altogether 4 to 5 lbs. of salt to 100 lbs. of
cheese. Every day it is rubbed with a dry rag and the
cheese is turned and salted on the other side until the
salt is thoroughly incorporated.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Swiss cheese press</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The cheese is cured for at least 100 days in the factory
and is usually stored
for another three to
six months by the
dealer before it is
ready for the consumer.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Roquefort.</b>—The
French <i>Roquefort</i> is
inoculated with a
mold from stale
bread which spreads
through the cheese
and produces the
peculiar flavor of this
type. It is made
from sheep’s milk
and was formerly
cured in cool subterranean
caverns, but
now in elaborate curing
houses. In this
country imitation
Roquefort is made of cow’s milk and cured in cold
storage.</p>

<p class='c014'>It should be remembered, however, that sheep’s milk
is very rich in fat and that a rich Roquefort that will
compare favorably with the genuine cannot be made
from cow’s milk without an addition of cream if sheep’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>or goat’s milk is not available. In France a small
addition of cow’s milk to the sheep’s milk—not to
exceed 10%—is often used.</p>

<p class='c014'>Around Roquefort a milk ewe produces on an average
135 lbs. of milk a year, which makes up to 35 lbs. of
cheese.</p>

<p><span class='small'>Milking the ewes at Roquefort, France (G. Ellbrecht)</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The milk is set at about 80° with rennet sufficient to
coagulate it in 1½ to 2 hours. To cut or break and
stir the curd, tools similar to those used in the manufacture
of Dutch cheese are employed and stirring is
continued until the pieces of curd are about the size
of peas when the whey is dipped off and the curd is
further broken with the hand and placed on a cloth to
drain. In fifteen minutes it is ready to be put into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>hoops which are either of glazed stoneware or perforated
tin, 8 inches in diameter by 4 in. high.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ground stale, moldy bread is sprinkled in the curd
as it is put into the hoop, at the rate of 1 part of bread
to 10,000 parts of curd. This moldy bread is prepared
from 2 parts of wheat flour and 1 part of rye flour
leavened with sour yeast and vinegar and baked hard.
The loaf is placed in a dark, moist cellar to mold. In
six weeks it is penetrated with mold when it is dried
at 86° and pulverized, forming the powder used for
inoculation into the cheese-curd.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the hoops are filled they are placed in large
wooden boxes at a temperature of 65° to 70° for the
whey to drain off. The first few days the cheese is
turned three times a day, later once a day, and when five
days old it is brought into the curing room where it
remains until it is firm enough to be shipped to the
large cold storage establishments, where it is taken care
of until ready for the general market.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the “caves” a high degree of moisture, a low
temperature—40° to 50°—and pure air are essential
conditions.</p>

<p class='c014'>The cheese is first <i>salted</i> by being rubbed repeatedly
with salt on all sides. The slime forming on the surface
is brushed or scraped off so as not to prevent the admission
of air, which is essential to the curing. In
order to further facilitate the penetration with air the
cheese is now <i>pricked</i> with numerous needles by means
of a machine and placed on the shelf in the cave where
the proper moisture and temperature are maintained.</p>

<p class='c014'>Various fermentations are now developing, one after
another, regulated by scraping, ventilation, etc., until
in six to twelve weeks the cheese is ready for the market
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>and is packed for shipment in paper or in tinfoil and
in wicker baskets or airtight boxes, according to destination,—for
home consumption or for export.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Parmesan Cheese</b> is an Italian cheese made mostly
in the Valley of the River Po and named from the City
of Parma. It is produced from partly-skimmed milk
and is allowed to become hard and dry, being used
grated with macaroni.</p>

<p class='c014'>The milk is set with rennet at a comparatively high
temperature, about 95° F., and when it is firmly curdled
it is broken up and stirred rather vigorously, which
makes the curd fine and dry. Color is now added—powdered
<i>Saffron</i>—at the rate of 0.5 gram to 100 kg.
milk. The curd is cooked slowly under constant stirring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>to a temperature up towards 100° when the whey should
be perceptibly acid.</p>

<p class='c014'>The curd is then allowed to settle in the round kettle
and when fairly firm it is lifted up in a cloth, the same
as in Swiss cheesemaking. The mold is also much the
same as the Swiss and the curd is but slightly pressed.
In the course of the day the cheese is turned once or
twice and put into fresh cloth. The next day it is put
into the curing room when it is rubbed with salt. In a
few months the cheese is cured and is then scraped
and polished with linseed oil. Sometimes it is kept
in storage two or three years in a dark room at a
temperature of 63° F. The composition averages:
32% water, 21% fat, 41% nitrogenous matters and
6% ash.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Caccio Cavallo</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c014'><b>Caccio Cavallo</b> is made in Southern Italy of a form
almost like a beetroot. The milk is set with rennet at
about 95° F. and after the curd has been
broken up the whey is dipped off and
heated to boiling when it is poured back
on the curd. The mass is then allowed
to ferment eight to fourteen hours according
to the temperature of the air.
The quality of the cheese depends largely
on this fermentation. The fermented
curd is cut into pieces and submerged in
boiling water and is then kneaded and formed into the
desired shape.</p>

<p class='c014'>After lying in cold water for two hours and in brine
for thirty hours it is dried and smoked until it attains
a fine golden color. It is made in various sizes, from 5
to 20 pounds, and the yield is said to vary from 10% to
16% of the milk. Caccio Cavallo is eaten on bread as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>well as with macaroni and is much relished by the
Italians.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Limburger</b>, <b>Brick</b>, <b>Munster</b> and other similar semi-soft
cheese of the proverbial strong flavor, originated
in Belgium and Bavaria, but are now largely made in
Northern New York and Wisconsin as well.</p>

<p class='c014'>For Limburger the milk is not ripened as for Cheddar
but is set with rennet quite sweet at a temperature of
about 90°; the curd is cut rather soft, care being taken,
however, not to lose butter-fat. The curd is but slightly
“cooked,” to a temperature not to exceed 96°, and is
not salted in the vat but is dipped out into perforated
wooden boxes or molds about 5 inches square and left
to drain without pressure. The cheese are placed edgeways
like bricks on shelves and are rubbed with salt
and turned every day until cured. During the curing
process moisture exudes and a fermentation takes place
which develops the well-known “Limburger” flavor.
After eight or ten weeks the cheese is packed in paper
and tinfoil and is ready for the market.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Brick</b> cheese is something between a Cheddar and a
Limburger, of a milder flavor than either, not as hard
as the former but firmer than the latter.</p>

<p class='c014'>The milk is slightly ripened and is set with rennet at
86° so as to coagulate in 20 minutes. The curd is
“cooked” to 110° or more and is not allowed to “mat”
as for Cheddar cheese, but is dipped out of the vat
before much acidity has developed, into the molds,
which are rectangular boxes without top or bottom
placed on a draining table where the whey runs off.</p>

<p class='c014'>The mold is usually 5 inches wide, 8 inches deep and
10 inches long. When it is filled with curd a follower
is put on the top and a slight weight, a couple of bricks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>on the follower. The cheese is turned a few times and
the next day it is taken out of the mold and placed on
the salting table. The salting is done by rubbing the
cheese on all sides with salt which penetrates the curd
and draws out moisture. This is repeated for 3 days
and the cheese is then left to cure, being washed and
wiped off every week to prevent molding.</p>

<p class='c014'>Brick cheese is shipped one or two months old. It
is wrapped in paper and packed twenty in a box.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Munster Cheese</b> is very much the same as Brick
except for the form, it being round, molded in a perforated
tin hoop instead of the box used for Limburger
and Brick.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>SOFT RENNET CHEESE</h3>

<p class='c022'>The soft cheese made with rennet may be classified
as <i>fresh</i> and <i>cured</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Neufchatel.</b>—The fresh soft cheese of the <i>Neufchatel</i>
or <i>Cream Cheese</i> type is easily made and may be produced
in any house from a small quantity of milk. The
milk is set at a comparatively low temperature, usually
72° F., with very little rennet, just enough to coagulate
the milk in about eighteen hours. During that time a
slight acidity develops in the milk. When it is firmly
curdled it is carefully dipped on to cheese-cloth suspended
on a frame, or into cotton bags where it drains
overnight.</p>

<p class='c014'>To make the cheese quickly a starter is sometimes
used and more rennet employed. The milk is heated
to 80° F., 25% starter and 7½ c.c. of rennet extract,
or one rennet tablet per hundred pounds of milk, are
added and the milk curdles in about 30 minutes.</p>

<p class='c014'>After draining for a few hours the curd is gently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>pressed for a similar time. When the whey is fairly
well expelled, the curd is kneaded or run through a meat
cutter with a little salt, not more than 2½ oz. to 10 lbs.
of curd. The outfit and the manipulation is essentially
the same as described under Cottage cheese.</p>

<p class='c014'>A superior quality is obtained by pasteurizing the
milk and if that is done a pure culture starter should
always be used. If the slow setting method is used a
very small amount of starter, say ½%, is sufficient, but
when the quick process is employed 10% to 25% may be
added.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Molding Neufchatel cheese</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>To give it a good appearance for market, the cheese
is molded in little tin molds very much like a quarter-pound
baking powder
can with open ends.
The cylindrical roll
of cheese is wrapped
in parchment paper
and tinfoil and is immediately
ready for
consumption. In an
ice box it will keep
for a week or so.
Neufchatel cheese
may be made from
whole milk or partly-skimmed
milk. The yield is from 10 to 20 lbs. out of
100 lbs. of milk.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Cream Cheese</b> is usually made in the same way. A
mixture of cream and milk containing about 10%
butter-fat is used, though sometimes the cream is not
added until the time of salting. The mold is square,
2½” × 1½” × 2” deep. These soft kinds of cheese are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>often mixed with chopped peppers, olives or nuts and
make excellent sandwiches.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Cured Soft Cheese.</b>—For <i>Cream</i> or <i>Neufchatel</i> cheese,
made for curing, the curd is salted more than for fresh
cheese, or the molded cheese is rolled in salt. For a
week or two it is placed in a curing room on straw
mats or the like where it ferments slightly before being
wrapped and packed for shipment.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>French Soft Cheese.</b>—The many forms of French soft
cheese as represented by the <i>Brie</i>, the <i>Camembert</i>, etc.,
are subjected to special fermentations which give to
each its peculiar flavor. Attempts have been made to
use pure cultures of the bacteria active in such fermentations
and so reduce the art of cheesemaking to
a more scientific process. But it has been found that
any desired kind of cheese cannot be made simply by
adding a culture of this or that bacterium to pasteurized
milk. Of vastly greater importance for the development
of the proper bacteria and flavor is the handling of the
milk and the curd by the experienced cheesemaker.
Inoculation with a pure culture alone does not make
the special cheese wanted.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>Cottage Cheese.</b>—Of the sour milk types the common
<i>Cottage Cheese</i> is the best known. It is made from skim
milk which in a warm room will curdle when sour,
whether rennet and a starter are used or not. The thick
sour milk is heated to anywhere
between 100° and
120° and dipped into bags
of cheese-cloth hung up for
draining. The next day
light pressure is applied for
12 to 24 hours, when the
curd is kneaded, slightly
salted, formed into balls
and wrapped in parchment
paper or packed into jars.
For this purpose paraffined
paper jars are very practical.</p>

<p class='c014'>The more the curd is
heated in the whey the
drier will be the cheese. Often it is improved by allowing
the curd to become rather dry and then working new
milk or a little cream into it, according to the use to
which it is to be put—whether it is for bakers’ stock
or for the table.</p>

<p class='c014'>Simple directions for making Cottage cheese are
given in Farmers’ Bulletin 850 and A. I. 17, issued by
the United States Department of Agriculture from
which we reprint the following and copy the accompanying
illustrations:</p>

<p><span class='small'>Pouring the curdled milk on cloth to drain</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“One gallon of skim milk will make about 1½ pounds
of cheese. If the milk is sweet it should be placed in a
pan and allowed to remain in a clean warm place at a
temperature of about 75° F., until it clabbers. The
clabbered milk should have a clean, sour flavor. Ordinarily
this will take about 30 hours, but when it is
desirable to hasten the process a small quantity of
clean-flavored sour milk may be mixed with the sweet
milk.</p>

<p class='c014'>“As soon as the milk has thickened or firmly clabbered
it should be cut into pieces 2 inches square, after
which the curd should be stirred thoroughly with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>spoon. Place the pan of broken curd in a vessel of
hot water so as to raise the temperature to 100° F.
Cook at that temperature for about 30 minutes, during
which time stir gently with a spoon for 1 minute at 5-minute
intervals.</p>

<p><span class='small'>Lifting the cloth back and forth to facilitate draining</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“At the conclusion of the heating, pour the curd
and whey into a small cheese-cloth bag (a clean salt
bag will do nicely) and hang the bag in a fruit-strainer
rack to drain, or the curd may be poured into a colander
or a strainer over which a piece of cheese-cloth has been
laid. After 5 or 10 minutes work the curd toward the
center with a spoon. Raising and lowering the ends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>of the cloth helps to make the whey drain faster. To
complete the draining tie the end of the bag together
and hang it up. Since there is some danger that the
curd will become too dry, draining should stop when
the whey ceases to flow in a steady stream.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Pressing the curd</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“The curd is then emptied from the bag and worked
with a spoon or a butter paddle until it becomes fine
in grain, smooth, and of the consistency of mashed
potatoes. Sour or sweet cream may be added to increase
the smoothness and palatability and improve
the flavor. Then the cheese is salted according to taste,
about one teaspoonful to a pound of curd.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Because of the ease with which the cheese can be
made it is desirable to make it often so that it may be
eaten fresh, although if it is kept cold it will not spoil
for several days. If the cheese is not to be eaten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>promptly it should be stored in an earthenware or glass
vessel rather than in one of tin or wood, and kept in a
cold place.”</p>

<p><span class='small'>Apparatus needed in making cottage cheese</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c014'><b>Making Cottage Cheese with Rennet.</b>—In the bulletin
mentioned a method is also given for making the cheese
with rennet or pepsin. Junket Tablets make a convenient
form of rennet to be used for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c014'>The advantages claimed for this method are:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. A finer textured and more uniform cheese.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. The making requires less time and attention.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. Losses of fat in the whey are reduced.</p>

<p class='c014'>The process is the same as described above except
that a solution of <i>Junket Tablets</i> is added to the milk
at the rate of one tablet to 100 lbs. of milk. For less
milk use a fraction of a tablet, or dissolve one tablet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>in ten tablespoonfuls of water and use one spoonful
of the solution for each 10 lbs. of milk.</p>

<p class='c014'>If a starter is used the rennet solution is added immediately
after the starter is put in; if no starter is used
the milk is left for five or six hours at 80° F. to ripen before
adding the rennet. The milk will curdle overnight.</p>

<p class='c014'>After draining for thirty minutes on cotton sheeting
the ends of the cloth are tied together and a weight is
placed on top to press the curd gently until the desired
consistency is attained.</p>

<p class='c014'>Salt may be worked in at the rate of 2½ ounces to 10
lbs. of curd. If desired, add sweet or sour cream at
the rate of ½ pint to 10 lbs. of curd or ¼ pint of cream
to the product from 30 lbs. of milk.</p>

<p class='c014'>It will be seen that Cottage cheese made with rennet
is really the same as Neufchatel cheese, the only difference
being in the form and packing or wrapping of the
finished cheese.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Snappy Cheese.</b>—By allowing the sour skim milk
curd to ferment under careful regulation, a variety of
sharp, snappy, more or less hard cheese can be made.
Though there is no general demand for them, some
kinds are quite popular in their own restricted localities.
The Danish <i>Appetite cheese</i> is only one of the many varieties
which have as many names.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Club Cheese</b> and similar varieties are made by grinding
up old dry cheese with a little butter and packing
the product in jars or other attractive packages. American,
Roquefort, or any other well-known type may be
used as the stock for these cheeses. Everywhere they
are favorites in dining cars and lunch rooms.</p>

<p><span class='small'>Milking the goat in Norway</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c014'><b>Whey Cheese.</b>—In Switzerland the so-called <i>Zieger
cheese</i> is made from sour whey, the albumin being coagulated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>by heat and,
with whatever butter-fat
there may be left
in the whey, skimmed
off the top. In Norway
<i>Myseost</i> (“Ost”
is Norwegian for
cheese) is made by
boiling down whey
almost to dryness.
If goat milk is available
to mix in, it
improves the cheese.
The main substance
is sugar of milk and
the cheese has a sweet, syrupy flavor.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>MILK SUGAR</h3>

<p class='c022'>The by-product, sugar of milk, is produced by acidifying
the whey, heating to boiling and neutralizing with
lime until the albumin is coagulated. It is then filtered
out and the clarified liquid is concentrated in vacuum.
From the thick syrup the sugar is allowed to crystallize
out, leaving the salts or mineral matters (milk-ash) in
the remaining liquid. The use of milk-sugar is limited
to medicinal purposes and for modifying milk for infants.
The production is therefore not very extensive.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>CASEIN</h3>

<p class='c022'>In a number of creameries casein is produced from
skim milk by precipitating it with an acid and drying
and pulverizing the precipitate. Casein is widely
used as a substitute for ivory, in billiard balls, buttons,
etc. It is also used as glue, and as a binder in paints.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>MILK POWDER</h3>
</div>

<p class='c022'>The production and use of dry milk has increased
enormously during the last few years and the processes
of manufacture have been improved well-nigh to perfection.
There are several methods practiced, the most
important being the following:</p>

<p class='c014'>The <i>Just-Hatmaker</i>, in which a large metal drum or
cylinder revolves slowly in a tank of milk. The drum
is heated by steam inside and, as it rolls out of the milk,
the metal surface picks up a thin film of milk which
quickly dries and is removed by a scraper.</p>

<p class='c014'>The <i>Eckenberg</i> process employs vacuum evaporating
pans, like those used for making condensed milk and
maple syrup.</p>

<p class='c014'>The <i>Merrell-Soule</i> Company’s method consists in
driving a blast of hot air into a fine spray of milk,
which at once reduces the milk to a fine powder.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the “<i>Economic</i>” process the milk is dried by hot
air the same as in the Merrell-Soule method, but in
dropping through a tower from a height of some 30
feet the milk meets several blasts of air of different
temperatures. It is claimed that in this way alone rich
milk and cream may be reduced to a powder without
injury to, or change of, the original fat globules.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Skim Milk Powder.</b>—Beautiful skim milk powders
are now made which dissolve perfectly in water. Containing,
as they do, the extremely nourishing constituents
of the fatless milk in a most palatable form, they
can be used in baking and in many food products to
great advantage.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Whole Milk Powder.</b>—Until recently dried whole
milk was not produced of good keeping quality as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>butter-fat had a tendency to become rancid before
many months. But improvements are constantly
being made and milk powders of every degree of richness
bid fair to take the place of fresh milk on board
ships and in other places where milk must be kept a
long time before being used.</p>

<p class='c014'>In many new food preparations of value, milk powder
is filling a long-felt want. Dissolved in 8 or 9 times as
much water, milk powder makes a liquid almost identical
with pasteurized fresh milk.</p>

<p class='c014'>It has already been mentioned under the chapter on
“Cream” and under “Ice Cream” how skim milk
powder and unsalted butter, <i>emulsified</i> in a suitable
amount of water or milk, make an excellent material
for ice cream.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>CONDENSED AND EVAPORATED MILK</h3>

<p class='c022'>Milk cannot be boiled down in a common open kettle
or steam boiler without being scorched. Evaporating
or condensing is therefore usually done in a vacuum
pan at a low temperature. Condensed to one-third of
its volume and excluded from the air by canning, milk
will keep well for months, and has many uses as a substitute
for fresh milk. Often sugar is added as a preservative,
and where sugar would be added anyway,
as in coffee, ice cream, etc., this is unobjectionable.</p>

<p class='c014'>For purposes where sugar is not wanted, unsweetened
condensed or evaporated milk is on the market,
so carefully made that the taste of the original milk
is hardly changed at all by the process. When water
is added in the proportion of two parts of water to one
of the evaporated milk, the fluid obtained excels even
that from milk powder in its resemblance to fresh milk.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>WHEY</h3>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Whey is a by-product in cheesemaking. Usually
it is fed to hogs and especially together with grain or
bran it makes an excellent food for them. But whey
is also prepared for human food. In the hospital or
in the home it serves as a substitute for milk when a
mild diet of easily digested food is temporarily required
for a weak stomach. For such purposes it must
not be allowed to become acid as in cheesemaking, but
should be prepared as the chief product from sweet
new milk or freshly separated skim milk. The sweet
milk is set with rennet—one Junket Tablet, dissolved
in cold water, to a quart of milk—at a temperature of
90° to 100° F. As soon as a firm curd is formed it is
carefully broken up and transferred to a strainer of
cheese-cloth. Unless it is to be used at once, the whey
strained off should be immediately cooled to 50° or
lower. If left at a higher temperature it will soon
become sour. A teaspoonful of limewater to a quart,
or a pinch of soda, will help to keep it sweet. Still,
in any event, it should not be kept long, but prepared
fresh when required.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Milk as a Food</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c013'>Milk is first of all the food for the young,—until a
certain age the only food, and a perfect food. It contains
but little refuse or waste and is under favorable
conditions almost wholly digestible.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>NUTRIENTS</h3>

<p class='c022'>All foods contain certain groups of nutrients which
may be classified according to various functions in nutrition
and their chemical composition.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Protein.</b>—The protein group of nutrients contains
nitrogen and is necessary for building up the tissues
of the body, the muscles and the tendons which also
contain nitrogen. Only by this group can tissues
wasted by constant wear and tear be rebuilt. Proteins
are the flesh-forming group. To some degree the proteins
or albuminoids are also active in producing fat
in the body, but the other groups of nutrients, especially
the fats, also contribute.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Fats and Carbohydrates.</b>—Another important function
of food is to produce and maintain the animal
heat. The main sources of this necessity are the fats
and the carbohydrates, so called because they consist
of the element carbon combined with oxygen and
hydrogen, the last two in the exact proportion in which
they are combined in water. All of these three groups
furnish the fuel, so to speak, for the body, but they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>are not equal in this respect. Pound for pound, when
burned in the body, the fats yield 2¼ times as much
heat as protein or the carbohydrates.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Mineral Matters.</b>—Finally there are in all foods the
mineral matters, a group containing a number of salts
which are indispensable because they are constituents
of every part of the body. Phosphate of lime, for instance,
makes up one-half of the substance of the bones,
and the sulphates and chlorides of potash and soda,
iron, etc., are everywhere present in smaller quantities.
No food in which any of them is lacking is complete.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Relation.</b>—The value of a food depends largely upon
the relation of one group of nutrients to another.
Proper nutrition can only be obtained when a sufficient
amount of flesh-forming as well as of heat-producing
nutrients are present, when the “nutritive ratio” is
properly balanced for the particular purpose in view,
be it the growth of the child, the maintenance of the
body, the restoration of matter consumed by labor of
body or brain, or the supply of heat to make up for
cold surroundings.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Milk contains all</b> of these groups of nutrients. The
protein is represented in milk by the casein and albumin,
the fats by the butter-fat, the carbohydrates
by milk-sugar, and the mineral matters by the milk-ash.
Human milk contains them in a perfect proportion
for infants, and for all purposes of nutrition cow’s
milk may be used to make up a “balanced ration,”
if not alone, then in connection with other food.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Nutritive Ratio.</b>—As we said before, the “nutritive
ratio” of a food means the ratio of its flesh-forming
constituents—proteins—to its heat-producing nutrients—carbohydrates
and fats. Cow’s milk, containing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>3.25% protein, 4% fat and 5% milk-sugar, has a nutritive
ratio of 1 : 4.3, i. e., 1 part of protein to 4.3 parts
of heat-giving nutrients, counting the fat equal to 2¼
of carbohydrates (multiplying the 4% fat by 2¼ makes
9, added to the 5% of sugar, makes 14; 3.25 to 14
equals 1 to 4.3). Skim milk, containing 3.4% protein,
0.2% fat, and 5.1% sugar, has a ratio of 1 : 1.6 (3.4 :
5.45). Mother’s milk, containing 2% protein, 4% fat,
and 6.5% carbohydrates, has a ratio of 1 : 7.75. To
substitute cow’s milk for mother’s, it must therefore
be “modified.”</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Calories.</b>—Another way of comparing various foods
than by the nutritive ratio is by measuring their “fuel
value” or energy-producing capacity. The amount of
heat required to raise the temperature of one kilogram
of water 1° C., or one pound 4° F., is called a calorie.
By extensive feeding experiments the caloric value of
the various nutrient groups has been estimated as
follows:</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Fallacy of Theoretical Valuation.</b>—While the contents
of protein and the ratio between digestible protein
and fats and carbohydrates on one hand, and the
fuel or energy value on the other, have long been the
only recognized measures for food values, they are admittedly
quite inadequate and insufficient
and although they are a
great help when used with discrimination
in making up food rations,
they are often abused by persons

<p class='c014'>“<b>Something Unknown.</b>”—Recent
investigations by Dr. F. G. Hopkins,
of Cambridge, England, and Dr. E.
V. McCollum, formerly of Wisconsin,
now of the Johns Hopkins University, have
proven conclusively that one food ingredient cannot
always be substituted for another with impunity even
though the most searching chemical analysis shows
them both alike in contents and digestibility. There is
“Something Unknown” in certain foods—“Vitamines”
some call it—essential especially in promoting the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>growth of the young, which our present knowledge of
chemistry cannot explain. In Bulletin No. 17 of the
Wisconsin Experiment Station experiments with the
feeding of rats are described which show how butter-fat
could not be replaced in the ration by vegetable fats of
apparently the same composition and digestibility without
disastrous results, and similar conditions have been
found in regard to other foodstuffs, proteins as well as
fats. The yolk of eggs and butter-fat contain this unknown
something which is absolutely essential for the
growth of the child and which is missing in most substitutes,
especially in lard and vegetable fats.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i144.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>The rat on the left got five per cent of cottonseed oil and the one on the right got instead one and a half per cent of butter-fat, otherwise their rations were alike. These results are typical for any ration made up of purified foodstuffs with butter-fat in them as compared with any fat of plant origin. The plant fats lack an unknown something without which growth cannot proceed.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The above illustration is from the work of McCollum
and Davis at the Wisconsin Experiment
Station.</p>

<p class='c014'>Realizing the fallacy of the old rules for making up
rations for the feeding of farm animals, Professor
Evvard of Iowa is trying the <i>reliability</i> of the <i>instincts</i>
of animals as a guide to the proper selection of the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>favorable combinations and proportions of food ingredients.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c017'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

</div>

<p class='c014'>We mention these experiments as a warning against
placing too great reliance on the caloric theory or the
relation of nutrients in making up food rations. We
have yet much to learn and the good housewife trying
to cook according to scientific rules will do well not to
neglect the palatability of the food, but to watch the
“instinct” which causes the child or the adult to reject
or approve of, and enjoy, the food, which in most cases
is a better guide than calories or protein contents, or
the ration between the various groups of nutrients.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>CARE OF MILK IN THE HOME</h3>

<p class='c022'>If received fresh and warm from the cow, milk should
at once be strained through absorbent cotton or several
thicknesses of cheese-cloth into wide-mouthed bottles
or glass jars and placed in running water or ice water
to cool as quickly as possible. If obtained from the
milkman it may be left in the bottle in which it is received.
The practice of delivering milk “loose,” dipping
it from the wagon, should not be permitted, and
is fast being abolished. Public safety demands that it
should be bottled on the farm or in the creamery or
milk station under sanitary conditions.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Keep the Milk Cool.</b>—If the milk when delivered at
the house is not cold enough to keep sweet as long as
desired, it should, we repeat, be placed in ice water or
cold running water until thoroughly cooled. Even if
the air is cold, in the ice box, for instance, the milk
cannot be cooled quickly enough without water. After
it has been cooled in water it may be put in the ice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>box. In most ice boxes the temperature is allowed to
rise higher than is generally supposed, and it is better
to keep the milk bottle next to the ice than in the food
compartments.</p>

<div  class='figleft id015'>
<img src='images/i146.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>A clean ice box</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Milk and cream easily absorb flavors from the air
and should not be kept in open vessels next to other
food. Any housekeeper
knows how
quickly milk or cream
will be tainted by
standing in the same
compartment with
onions or muskmelons;
if the bottle
is not covered, milk
may also be contaminated
by other less
noticeable but more
harmful vapors from
nearby products. Let
the milkman furnish
you with some extra
milk bottle caps, or cover your milk bottle with an inverted
tumbler.</p>

<p class='c014'>As has been shown in previous chapters, milk is a
favorable soil for all sorts of germs and bacteria to grow
in. It must therefore be kept from contamination
with the utmost care, and everything that comes in
contact with it must be scrupulously clean.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Top-Milk.</b>—When the milk has been standing at
rest three or four hours, the top-milk will be considerably
richer than the rest. If such rich milk is wanted
for any particular purpose it may be poured off, to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>eaten with cereals, berries, etc. In twelve hours most
of the cream will rise and may be skimmed off, although
thirty-six or even forty-eight hours may be required to
get all that can be obtained by setting. The half-skimmed
milk left when the top-milk has been removed
after 3 to 6 hours’ setting will still contain 2% or more
of butter-fat and is very good for drinking; even the
skim milk from which the cream has been taken after
12 hours’ setting is still an excellent beverage, provided
it is sweet. Perfectly skimmed, almost entirely fatless,
milk may be used in various ways in cooking, to make
up for lack of protein in many other food products.
But care must be taken that it is pure and sweet, or
rather, its condition, sweet or sour, must be under the
perfect control of the housekeeper. If a sample of milk
will stand scalding or even boiling without curdling,
it is usually fresh and in good condition for any use.
On the other hand, if it curdles by scalding, it is beyond
control and it may or may not make good sour milk,
depending on the bacteria working in it.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Modifying Milk.</b>—Undiluted cow’s milk is too rich
in protein and in salts for infants and, when fed without
modification, must be diluted with an equal amount
of water during the first two or three months. Such dilution,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>however, also reduces the percentage of fat, which
should remain the same, and of carbohydrates, which
should be increased. In order to modify or “humanize”
cow’s milk so as to make its composition nearly the
same as that of mother’s milk, simple dilution with
water is therefore not sufficient.</p>

<p class='c014'>There are, however, various other methods which
may be used to advantage. For instance, top-milk
from a bottle of fresh milk which has stood 4 or 6 hours
in ice water will contain 6 to 8% of fat. By diluting
this with an equal part of water, the percentage
of protein, fat and mineral matter will be about right,
and sugar, either cane-sugar or milk-sugar, may be
added to supply the carbohydrates. Or carefully prepared
sweet whey containing milk-sugar, or barley
water, may be added to the thin cream in place of some
of the pure water.</p>

<p class='c014'>The following recipes have been used with good
results:</p>
<h4 class='c025'>Mrs. Pospyhala’s Recipe</h4>

<p class='c030'><b>Infant Food.</b>—Warm 1½ quarts of milk to blood heat. Remove
from fire and add one Junket Tablet dissolved in a spoonful
of cold water. Let the milk set until it forms a solid mass, then
stir it up in order to break the curd. Place it back on the fire and
stir until quite smooth, not allowing it to get any warmer than
blood heat. It is then ready to strain through two thicknesses of
cheese-cloth and care must be taken to squeeze well so as to obtain
as much of the whey as possible, which is very important. Add one
tablespoonful of sugar to sweeten. Pour into nursing bottles, the
amount being according to the age of the baby. A sufficient number
of bottles are prepared for 24 hours’ feeding. Care should be
taken to keep the milk in a cool place as it will sour the same as
fresh milk. Every time the baby is fed the milk must be warmed
by placing the bottle in a pan of water and heating to the right
temperature.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>
  <h4 class='c025'><i>Mrs. Rorer’s Recipe</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c030'>Where cow’s milk, even when diluted, or partly modified as in
the home fashion, disagrees with the infant, this mixture may be
used with good results: heat two quarts of milk to 100° F. Add
two Junket Tablets dissolved in a tablespoonful of cold water.
When the milk is congealed and perfectly solid draw through it
backward and forward an ordinary four-tined silver fork; this will
separate the curd. Strain through two thicknesses of cheese-cloth,
saving the whey as this is the part you are to use; add a pint of
water, a half ounce of sugar of milk, three ounces of cream and
four ounces of the white of egg. The whites may be dropped into
a quart fruit jar, a pint of the whey added, the top screwed on and
the jar thoroughly shaken until the whites are well mixed with
the whey; then add them to the remaining quantity and stand at
once in a very cold place. This will be given in quantities from
two to three ounces in an ordinary nursing bottle.</p>

prescription may be necessary. Even if the modified
cow’s milk is prepared so as to contain apparently
the same proportion of the various groups of nutrients
as mother’s milk, there may still be some essential
difference. For instance, the protein in human milk
consists mainly of albumin, while that of cow’s milk
is mostly casein. It is often a question whether the
individual baby can digest the casein without trouble.
A trifle of rennet ferment,—a fraction of a Junket
Tablet,—added to the modified cow’s milk just before
feeding may be beneficial to overcome that defect. A
little limewater also is healthful as it neutralizes any
acid that may develop in the mixture. For the particular
needs of the individual baby, a competent doctor
should be asked to prescribe.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>MILK FOR GROWING CHILDREN</h3>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i152.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c022'>When the child is big enough to thrive on undiluted,
unmodified cow’s milk, it should not only be allowed,
but urged, to continue on a diet in which this, the
best of all foods, is the most essential part. An excellent
form in which to feed milk to the growing child is
junket. Eaten slowly with a spoon as a pudding, it is
exposed to the action of digestion much better than
milk swallowed by the glassful in a hurry and even if it
is cold there is no danger of defective rennet action in
the stomach because such action has already taken
place.</p>

<p class='c014'>Doctors still disagree as to the desirability of pasteurizing
milk for young children (see “Pasteurization,”
Chapter <a href='#ch01'>I</a>), some holding that the digestibility is affected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>by the process. The truth is probably that
strong pasteurization at a temperature above 157° and
holding the heated milk unnecessarily long at such high
temperature do change the properties of the milk so
as to make it harder to digest, but that the main difficulty
is in the change of diet from raw to pasteurized
milk or vice versa. Let the child get used to the change
by making it gradual, diminishing the amount of one
and increasing the amount of the other from day to day
in a week, until the change is completed, and there will
usually be little if any trouble. The secretions of digestive
ferments in the stomach soon adapt themselves
to the change in the food. The same holds good in
case of other changes, as, for instance, from whole
milk to more or less fatless milk, with additions of
cereals or other partial substitutes;—it is always advisable
to make any change in the child’s diet gradual.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Milk Cookery</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c013'>Milk should also be used a great deal more than it
is by grown persons, not only as a drink but in the
daily cookery. In some homes milk in some form is
a part of every menu and the meals are more delicious,
attractive and nourishing than the ordinary milkless
diet, and are also less expensive, as the milk takes the
place of part of the meat. Dr. Graham Tusk of Cornell
University, who represented the United States on the
Interallied Council of Alimentation, says:</p>

<p class='c030'>“No family of five should spend any money for meat
until three quarts of milk have been purchased, and
this should be done even though the price of milk
should go to twenty cents a quart. Absolutely nothing
in the food line will keep children so healthy as their
daily supply of milk.”</p>

<p class='c022'>In cooking with milk it is well to remember:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. That, although milk is a liquid, it contains a
large amount of solid food and of exceedingly nourishing,
palatable and easily digestible food, much more
than many vegetables or fruits. While milk has 13%
of solid matter, water-melon has only 2%, turnips 4%,
beets 12%, etc. When substituting milk for water,
you add <i>nourishment</i> to the food and it is well to keep
in mind the ingredients,—the amount of protein, fat,
etc., added in the form of milk, which may take the
place of other similar ingredients in the combination.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>2. That if milk is even but slightly sour, or if some
other acid is added to it,—in the form of fruit, for instance,—it
is apt to curdle by scalding or boiling.</p>

<p class='c014'>The limits of a single chapter do not allow many
recipes to be given, but a few are furnished under each
of the several kinds of milk dishes, and a clever domestic
science pupil or the ordinary good housekeeper and
cook can easily add to these recipes indefinitely, by
following out the simple suggestions offered.</p>

<p class='c033'>Wash the spinach and cook thirty minutes in boiling water to
which ⅛ teaspoon soda has been added. Drain and chop fine.
Add stock and butter and flour cooked together, milk and seasoning.</p>

<p class='c022'>Cauliflower, mushrooms, lettuce, string beans, onions
and other vegetables may be used for soups in the
same way. <i>In all of these recipes milk may be substituted
for the stock.</i> The soups will be more nourishing, many
like them better, and they are more easily prepared.</p>

<p class='c014'>If canned vegetables are used they may be added to
the thickened milk, which should be made in the proportions
of one quart of milk to two tablespoons butter
or substitute and two tablespoons flour. One can of
beans, peas, asparagus, or corn, may be added to three
pints of thickened milk.</p>

<p class='c014'>If fresh vegetables are used, they should be boiled
in as little water as possible and this water added with
the vegetables to the hot, thickened milk. The addition
of one-half to one cup of cream to these soups improves
their taste but is not necessary. If the cream
is whipped and added just before serving, the appearance
is also much improved. The vegetables may be
pressed through a sieve or not, as preferred. If the
soup is to be served in cups it is better to do this or
chop the vegetables very fine, but if the soup is to be
served in soup plates it looks attractive and is more
substantial if the vegetables are cut in inch pieces and
left in the soup.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Cereal Cream Soups.</b>—There is another class of soups
used much in Europe but, unfortunately, little known
here. They are very nourishing, easy of preparation,
and delicious.</p>

<p class='c014'>A few recipes will suffice to introduce the housewife
to this class of soups and she can then easily add to the
varieties herself. Her family will enjoy the new dishes
for their good taste and their novelty. Croutons,
crackers, zwieback, or toast may be served with any
of them. They should always be prepared in a double
boiler.</p>

    <div><b>Milk Chowders</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c033'>Chowders are also a very acceptable way of serving milk. For
rich chowders the proportions used are: Two cups of milk or of
milk and water, 1 cup of potatoes cut into small pieces and 1 pound
of fish. For flavoring add an onion fried in two tablespoons of fat
tried out from salt pork. While these proportions make a rich dish,
it is possible to reduce the amount of fish greatly, to leave it out
entirely, to use small portions of left-over fish or some salt codfish
which has been freshened, or to substitute corn for it. Such dishes
are palatable and of reasonably high nutritive value, providing the
greater part of the liquid used is milk.</p>

<p class='c022'>Similar, but less rich and thick, is:</p>

      <div class='line'>1 cupful raw potatoes cut into small pieces</div>

      <div class='line'>1 cupful of codfish cut into small pieces or just enough to flavor the stew</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c033'>Soak the fish in lukewarm water until it is soft and the salt removed.
Cook the potatoes in water until tender, drain them, add
the milk and codfish, and bring to the boiling point; add the butter
and salt to taste.</p>

<p class='c022'>In place of the codfish, fresh fish, clams, oysters, or
a little chipped beef may be used. Or the fish may be
omitted and the soup made savory and palatable by
adding a few drops of onion juice, or cheese or a vegetable
cut into small pieces and cooked thoroughly.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>MILK CEREALS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Most cereals are better cooked in milk than in water
and those not familiar with this method have no idea
of the many good dishes which they can thus easily
provide for their families. Cereals so prepared make
an especially good wholesome breakfast or supper for
school children and the writer has never seen an adult,
who, on a cold night, did not enjoy a dish of rice, or
corn meal, boiled in milk and served with cream and
sugar for supper. Milk cereals must always be cooked
in a double boiler and the milk must be hot when the
cereal is added.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Cream of Wheat or Farina Pudding</b> is also delicious.
It is prepared in the same way, but ¾ cup of cereal
only is added to 1 quart hot milk. Just before serving,
a teaspoonful of vanilla is added, and two beaten eggs
are folded in. It is eaten with cream, or milk, and
sugar, or with maple syrup.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>LUNCHEON AND SUPPER DISHES</h3>

<p class='c022'>Dishes prepared principally of milk, with the addition
of either eggs, cheese, meat, or vegetables are particularly
adapted for luncheon or supper use. Here again
a few standard recipes are given which can be varied
to make any desired number of good, wholesome and
delicious dishes.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span><b>Creamed Dishes.</b>—The same sauce may be used to
cream <i>cold chicken</i>, <i>lamb</i>, <i>veal</i>, <i>chipped beef</i>, and cold
boiled or baked <i>fish</i>, canned <i>salmon</i>, <i>lobster</i> or <i>shrimps</i>,
according to the following recipe:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c008'>
    <div><b>Creamed Chicken</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>2 cups cold cooked chicken cut into dice</div>
      <div class='line'>3 tablespoons butter</div>
      <div class='line'>3 tablespoons flour</div>
      <div class='line'>1½ cups milk</div>
      <div class='line'>Salt and pepper</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c033'>Melt butter and add the flour and milk. Bring to the boiling
point and add diced chicken. Season with salt and pepper.</p>

<p class='c022'>Many grate a small onion into the sauce before adding
the chicken. The writer does not favor indiscriminate
use of onion as it tends to make all dishes taste
alike. It seems better to use sometimes a little celery
or celery salt, sometimes an onion, and again frequently
no flavor but the chicken or meat or fish. One’s cooking
is thus more distinctive and varied.</p>

<p class='c014'>If the creamed mixture is turned into a baking dish,
covered with buttered bread or cracker crumbs and
browned in the oven, the result is even more pleasing.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such a sauce flavored with cheese makes a good and
very nutritious gravy to pour over cauliflower and cabbage
or to serve with boiled rice or hominy or poured
over toast.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>CREAMED VEGETABLES</h3>

<p class='c022'>In creaming vegetables the proportion is usually 1
cup of sauce to 2 cups of vegetables. <i>Potatoes</i>, <i>asparagus</i>,
<i>cauliflower</i>, <i>boiled onions</i>, <i>beans</i>, and <i>carrots</i>,
<i>beets</i> or <i>peas</i> are all delicious served in this way.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c008'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span><b>Eggs and Asparagus</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c033'>Cream asparagus. Arrange in a baking dish, alternate layers of
the asparagus and slices of hard boiled eggs. Cover with buttered
crumbs and bake till crumbs are a delicate brown.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>Souffles.</b>—Souffles are always delightful, and while
many consider them difficult to make they are really
very simple and if made correctly are always to be depended
upon. They should, however, be eaten at once
when baked.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Salmon</i>, <i>chicken</i>, <i>lamb</i>, <i>veal</i>, <i>ham</i> and <i>cheese</i>, and also
many vegetables such as <i>asparagus</i>, <i>cauliflower</i> and
<i>peas</i> may be prepared in this way. Elaborate recipes
are often given, but the following is entirely sufficient
and always satisfactory:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>2 cups chopped meat or vegetables cut fine</div>
      <div class='line'>2 cups thick white sauce</div>
      <div class='line'>Yolks of 2 eggs</div>
      <div class='line'>Whites of 2 eggs</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c033'>To the meat or vegetables add white sauce (2 tablespoons butter
and 3 tablespoons flour to 1 cup milk) and beaten yolks. Cool and
add whites beaten stiff. Bake 30 minutes in moderate oven. This
makes a dish large enough to serve four or five persons.</p>

<p class='c022'>A similar dish, Cheese Fondu, is also good, and can
stand longer than a souffle before serving.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c008'>
    <div><b>Cheese Fondu</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>2 cups milk</div>
      <div class='line'>2 cups minced cheese</div>
      <div class='line'>1 cup bread crumbs</div>
      <div class='line'>2 eggs beaten</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c033'>Bake in a hot oven for twenty minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'>Variations of this dish are made by substituting one
cup minced ham for one cup of the cheese, or by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>using two cups of ham and omitting the cheese altogether.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>MILK TOAST</h3>

<p class='c022'>A very good way to serve milk toast is to toast bread
thoroughly and to pour hot milk over it at the time of
serving. In serving milk toast in this way all the
dishes should be kept very hot. A heavy earthenware
pitcher may be used for serving the hot milk, as it
retains heat for a long time.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>EGGS POACHED IN MILK</h3>

<p class='c022'>Eggs are much better poached in milk than in water.
If served on toast the hot milk may be poured on the
egg if a soft toast is desired. If not, dip the eggs out
of the milk with a perforated spoon and lay on the
toast in the usual way, adding salt and butter.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>CHEESE DISHES AS MEAT SUBSTITUTES</h3>

<p class='c022'>Meat is wholesome and relished by most persons,
yet it is not essential to a well-balanced meal, and there
are many housekeepers who, for one reason or another,
are interested in lessening the amount of meat which
they provide or to substitute some other foods for it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cheese naturally suggests itself as a substitute for
meat, since it is rich in the same kinds of nutrients
which meat supplies, is a staple food with which everyone
is familiar, and is one which can be used in a great
variety of ways. In substituting cheese for meat, pains
should be taken to serve dishes which are relished by
members of the family. A number of recipes for dishes
which are made with cheese follow:</p>

<h3 class='c010'>COTTAGE CHEESE<br /><span class='c007'>(See also under the chapter on Cheese)</span></h3>

<p class='c022'>All that has been said of cheese as a valuable food
and as a substitute for meat, applies equally to cottage
cheese and it is so easily prepared, inexpensive and
generally relished that it should be used much more
freely than it is.</p>

<p class='c014'>The following recipes are only a few of the many
that might be given, but the careful cook should evolve
other combinations equally attractive.</p>

    <div><b>Cottage Cheese by Government Method</b></div>
    <div class='c000'>(From Food Administration Bulletin)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c033'>Unit, 1 gallon. For lesser amounts, measurements to be divided
accordingly.</p>

<p class='c035'>Take 1 gallon of sweet skim milk; add ¾ cup of clean, sour milk
and stir as it is put in. Raise the temperature in hot water to 75
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>degrees Fahrenheit, using a dairy thermometer. Remove from heat
and place where it is to remain until set. Add ⅛ of a junket
tablet thoroughly dissolved in a tablespoon of cold water; stir while
adding. Cover with cloth and leave for 12 to 16 hours in even
temperature, about 75 degrees Fahrenheit. At end of this period
there should be a slight whey on the top and when poured out the
curd should cleave sharply. Drain through cotton cloth, not
cheese-cloth. When whey has been drained out, work in 1 or 2
teaspoons of salt to the cheese, according to taste; 1½ to 2 pounds
of cheese should be obtained from a gallon of milk.</p>

<p class='c035'>For table use it is advisable to work in 1 or 2 tablespoons of cream
to the pound. For use in cooking, this is not necessary.</p>

<p class='c035'>One may also make cottage cheese of freshly soured milk by
simply heating it in a double boiler till whey forms, letting it stand
an hour and then turning it into a cheese-cloth bag to drain. To
the dry curd formed add sweet or sour cream and salt to taste.
When made in this way care must be taken that the milk is freshly
soured—if it is old it will have a bitter taste and the cheese will not
be good.</p>

Should this happen, by using a Dover egg beater it may be restored
to a smooth consistency, but custard will not be as thick. Eggs
should be beaten slightly for custard that it may be of smooth,
thick consistency. To prevent scum from forming, cover with a

that water surrounding mold does not reach boiling point or custard
will whey. Always bear in mind that eggs and milk combination
must be cooked at a low temperature. For cup custards allow
three eggs to four cups milk; for large molded custard four or five
eggs; if fewer eggs are used, custard is liable to crack when turned

<h3 class='c010'>GENERAL RECIPE FOR CEREAL-MILK PUDDINGS</h3>

<p class='c022'>Bread and rice puddings, made with milk and eggs,
are familiar to all cooks. Made without eggs, the following
will be found suggestive:</p>

<p class='c033'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>For a quart of milk allow ⅓ of a cup of any coarse cereal (rice,
cornmeal, cracked wheat, oatmeal or barley); add ⅓ of a cup of
brown, white or maple sugar, syrup, honey or molasses; ½ teaspoon
salt; ⅛ teaspoon spice. The flavoring may be omitted when honey
or molasses is used.</p>

<p class='c022'>The above recipe makes quite a large pudding. It
is often convenient to make a smaller one, and enough
for a child’s dinner can be made in the double boiler,
allowing two level or one rounding tablespoon of cereal
to a cup of salted and flavored milk. Cook an hour
and sweeten slightly.</p>

<p class='c014'>These puddings, if made thin, may be poured over
stewed prunes or other cooked fruits, and are a good
and economical substitute for the cream or soft custard
usually used for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c014'>A very old recipe for a baked corn pudding has recently
been given to the author.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>In the United States and Canada
as well as in England <i>Fahrenheit’s</i>
thermometer is generally used according
to which water freezes at 32°
and boils at 212° at ordinary air
pressure, leaving 180 degrees between
the freezing and the boiling point.
In some countries in Europe Réaumur’s
thermometer is used with 0° for
the freezing point and 80° for boiling. In France and
for scientific work in all countries, however, the Celsius
or Centigrade system is employed for measuring heat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>and cold, having 0° for freezing and 100° for boiling.
As there are 180° Fahrenheit, 80° Réaumur and 100°
Centigrade between freezing and boiling, the divisions
are therefore as 9° F. to 4° R. and 5° C.</p>

<p class='c014'>To change from degrees of F. above the freezing
point to the other systems deduct 32, divide the remainder
by 9 and multiply by 4 or by 5 respectively.
To change from C. to F. divide by 5, multiply by 9 and
add 32, etc. As the metric system is gradually being
introduced everywhere instead of the old systems for
weights and measures, so also is the Centigrade thermometer
being substituted for the others and in cookery
it may soon be used exclusively.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c044'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From circular No. 85 of a series of statements prepared under the
direction of the Secretary of Agriculture, covering the agricultural
situation for 1918.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c044'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>The Babcock Test</i> is operated as follows: When the milk has been
thoroughly mixed and a true sample has been taken the <i>pipette</i> is filled
to the mark by sucking the milk into it until it stands a little above the
mark on the stem, then quickly placing a dry finger over the end of
the pipette and allowing the milk to escape until it just reaches the mark.
The quantity thus measured off is 17.6 c.c. The pipette is then emptied
into the <i>test bottle</i> by placing the point in the neck and allowing the milk
to flow slowly down the inside of the neck, taking care not to lose any
of the milk. Blow the last drops out of the pipette into the bottle.</p>

<p class='c044'>The <i>measuring glass</i>, holding 17.5 c.c., is filled to the mark with
<i>sulphuric acid</i> of a specific gravity of 1.82 to 1.83 and this is poured into
the milk in the test bottle. The acid is a strong poison and must be
handled with care. Pour it slowly down along the wall of the bottle
which is held at an angle and turned slowly during the operation.</p>

<p class='c044'>Now give the bottle a rotary motion to thoroughly mix the milk
and the acid, shaking vigorously towards the end of the operation so
as to be sure not to leave any of the acid which is heavier than the milk
at the bottom of the bottle.</p>

<p class='c044'><i>Whirling.</i>—The bottles are then placed in the centrifugal machine
and whirled for five minutes at the proper speed—from 600 to 1200
revolutions per minute—according to the diameter of the machine
and as stated in the directions which come with the tester. The mixture
of milk and acid is hot enough if the whirling is done at once, but
if it is allowed to cool the bottles should be placed in hot water of 150
to 170° for about 15 minutes; whirling at full speed for 4 minutes brings
all the fat to the top.</p>

<p class='c044'>Hot water is now added until the bottle is filled almost to the scale
on the neck and the bottles are again placed in the machine and whirled
at full speed for one minute. Hot water is then again added until
the lower end of the fat column is within the scale, preferably at the
1% or 2% mark on the neck of the bottle. Whirl once more for
one or two minutes and then read off the percentage of fat on the scale.
Each division represents 0.2% fat. The fat column is measured from
the lower line between the fat and the water to the point where the top
of the fat column touches the wall of the neck. A pair of dividers are
handy for measuring the fat column and reading off the percentage of
fat in the milk. The bottle with contents should be warm—about 140°—when
the measure is taken.</p>

<p class='c044'>For testing skim milk and cream special forms of test bottles are
used—which are described in the circulars coming with the testers and
students who desire fuller information are referred to Farrington and
Woll’s “Testing Milk and its Products,” published by the Mendota
Book Co., Madison, Wis.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c044'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The <i>Acid Test</i> depends upon what in the laboratory is called “titration”
and makes use of a “burette,” a long, graduated measuring tube
provided with a pinch-cock. This burette is filled with an alkali solution
of known strength, usually a “tenth normal” solution of caustic
soda. A certain amount of the milk to be tested is measured off into
a glass or a white porcelain cup. As a 17.6 c.c. pipette belonging to the
Babcock test usually is at hand, that may be used for this purpose.
A few drops of an <i>Indicator</i> is added to the milk and under constant
stirring the soda solution is allowed to drip into it until suddenly it turns
pink. The color will quickly disappear, however, and a few more
drops of the alkali are added and stirred in several times until a faint
but distinct pink color remains for some time. That indicates that the
acid in the milk has been neutralized and the amount of the soda solution
consumed is then read off on the scale on the burette. By dividing
the number of c.c. of the soda solution used by two, the tenths per cent
of lactic acid in the milk is found. For example, if it takes 4 c.c. of the
soda solution to neutralize 17.6 c.c. milk, the acidity is .2%. This depends
upon the fact that 1 c.c. of a tenth normal soda neutralizes .009
gram of lactic acid and that therefore the per cent of acid in the milk
is equal to .009 multiplied by the number of c.c. of soda solution used,
divided by the number of c.c. of milk and multiplied by 100.</p>

<p class='c044'>If 50 c.c. of milk is taken instead of 17.6 the calculation is changed
accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c044'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Farmers’ Bulletin No. 602, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c044'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Butter Color</i> is made of the coloring matter of “Annatto” dissolved
in a refined vegetable (salad) oil. The Annatto tree (Bixa Orelana)
grows in the tropics and the seed which has a thin coating of this beautiful
coloring matter comes mostly from the West Indian Islands, Jamaica,
Porto Rico and Guadeloupe. It is perfectly harmless and is used by
the natives to flavor and color soup and other foods much as we use
tomatoes.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c044'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Marschall Rennet Test consists of a graduated cup (a) with
a fine hole for an outlet in the bottom. One cubic centimeter of a standard
rennet extract is diluted with water in the glass bottle (c). The cup
is filled with milk and placed on the corner of the cheese vat, the milk
being allowed to run through the fine hole in the bottom of the cup.
The moment the surface of the milk reaches the upper mark of the
graduation in the cup the diluted rennet extract is added and quickly
stirred into the milk with the spattle (d).</p>

<p class='c044'>When the milk begins to curdle it stops running out. The sweeter
the milk is the more will run out before coagulation stops it and the
mark on the scale at which it stops indicates the degree of acidity or
ripening. The point is to have the milk alike every day and if, for instance,
the cheesemaker has found that his cheese is best if he adds the
rennet to the milk in the vat when the test shows 2½, he wants to ripen
the milk to that degree every day. So, if the test shows 3 or 4, it indicates
that the milk is not sufficiently ripened and it should be allowed
to stand warm for a longer time before it is set with rennet.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c044'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Acidemeter for making an Acid Test is described in Chapter <a href='#ch01'>I</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c044'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Rennet (see under “Ferments” in Chapter <a href='#ch01'>I</a>) is prepared from the
third division of the stomach of the suckling or milk-fed calf. Fifty
years ago cheesemakers used to make their own rennet by soaking
salted calves’ stomachs in sour whey, and our grandmothers used a piece
of a dry, salted stomach to make Junket or “Curds and Whey.” About
1868, Christian Hansen, of Copenhagen, Denmark, began the preparation
of Commercial Rennet Extract which soon supplanted the
home-made rennet in all countries wherever cheese was made. Nowadays
rennet in liquid or powder or tablet form for cheesemaking, and
Junket Tablets for milk puddings, are prepared pure and of known
strength in laboratories and handled by druggists and dealers in dairy
supplies.</p>

<p class='c044'>The fresh stomachs are saved by the farmers or butchers and are
either blown up and dried in the air protected from sunlight and rain,
or split lengthwise and spread out flat and salted on both sides.</p>

<p class='c044'>In the laboratory the ferment is extracted by chemicals and a pure,
clear liquid extract is prepared, of uniform strength and good keeping
quality. Or the extract is condensed into a powder which again is
compressed into tablets of great strength.</p>

<p class='c044'>The ferment acts best when the milk is lukewarm, but it will do the
work at temperatures ranging from 50°, or even lower, to 120° F.
Strongly pasteurized or sterilized milk will not curdle with rennet,
but milk pasteurized at a low temperature is not changed enough to
prevent it from making a firm curd. More rennet does not make a
firmer curd but causes the milk to curdle quicker; less rennet makes
the process slower. Diluted milk will not curdle firmly, and the failure
of milk to make a smooth coagulum of the usual consistency and in
the usual time, the temperature being right and the regular amount
of a standard rennet being used, is a never-failing proof that something
is the matter with the milk. It has been changed from its natural condition
by over-heating in pasteurization or by watering or doctoring,
or it has not been properly ripened.</p>

<p class='c014'>This book is intended to aid the student and the
commercial manufacturer in better understanding
the principles of making and handling ice cream.
It is not primarily intended as a recipe-book, although
many recipes are included in the text.</p>

<p class='c014'>The first five chapters consist in a general discussion
of the materials used in the manufacture
of ice cream as well as the stabilizers and fillers
and flavoring materials. The next chapter deals
with the classification of ice creams, and here the
recipes are given. The equipment and refrigeration
are then explained in a separate chapter, followed
by three chapters devoted to the actual
making of ice cream.</p>

<p class='c014'>The concluding pages are taken up with an
analysis of the qualities of ice cream and of the
bacteriology of its manufacture. Such a discussion
should be useful both to the student in the
class-room and the progressive manufacturer.</p>

<p class='c014'>The revolution in dairy practice, brought about by the
introduction of the centrifugal cream separator and the
Babcock test for fat, by a more definite knowledge regarding
the various fermentations that so greatly influence milk,
and the manufacture of its products, have demanded the
publication of a book that shall give to the dairyman, and
particularly to the dairy student, in simple, concise form,
the principles underlying modern dairy practice. Such has
been Professor Wing’s purpose in this work. This is not a
new edition of the author’s very successful volume published
under the same title many years ago; it is, in reality, an
entirely new book, having been wholly reset and enlarged by
the addition of new matter, both text and illustrations. The
author’s aim has been at all times to give the present state
of knowledge as supported by the weight of evidence and the
opinions of those whose authority is highest.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
